This means in practical terms that we will use any appropriate resource from across our network to complete projects. , nan\nRelationships, nan, Does your company normally coordinate with creative agencies in the production management process? What is the best practice for ensuring the hand-off is seamless?, Collaboration is in our DNA at Jellyfish. We work with hundreds of creative, media, design and other agencies on a daily basis. In our experience, the best way to manage these relationships is for the client to be very clear about who does what and what the handover points are. Often we work closely with client marketing and procurement personnel to determine these from the outset of our engagement. Our contacts range from in-house Client Brand Managers to direct relationships with agency teams and suppliers on behalf of our clients \u2013 often working to ensure the seamless delivery of a global campaign. Some client quotes from a recent client survey undertaken by a third party at our request serve to underline this.\n\n\u201c...they had seamlessly managed to integrate working in quite a difficult situation between client and creative agency and keep both sets of people happy, deliver the work and not upset the agency or the relationship that the client has with the agency.\u201d \u201c...it would be very easy for a normal production agency to tread on people\u2019s toes too much, but they have managed it very well indeed\u201d. \n\nOur VIVID workflow and approval platform underpins this ability to work collaboratively with multiple entities.\n, Oct 2021\nRelationships, nan, Please confirm local/global agency (creative/media) partners you work with frequently.

This establishes the framework within which great work can be created efficiently.\n\nPeople: You need to ensure you have the right people in place both within the agencies you are working with and respectfully within your own organization. By the \u2018right people\u2019 we mean those who are collaborative, open to learning, have strong team ethic and creatively driven. Everyone needs to understand their role and responsibilities and how they personally add value in order to effectively deliver creative excellence consistently. The setting of KPIs helps drive the right behaviors. A spirit of transparency needs to be encouraged between agencies to ensure successful collaboration.\n\nProcess: It\u2019s vital to have a process that is clear and understood by all parties.

At the start of the engagement, an induction and onboarding process is required. In addition as on large and complex pieces of business, staff turnover is inevitable, so it\u2019s crucial to ensure there is an ongoing induction process in place for any new people that subsequently join the team. This should be for both client and agency representatives. Another aspect Jellyfish likes to see embedded in any process is the use of regular \u2018wash-up\u2019 sessions. It also pays dividends to have a process to widely disseminate learnings and to ensure best practice is being constantly shared. This can be managed simply, for example via a monthly update email to the team/s.\n\nTechnology: Supporting your people and processes with the right \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 and easy to use technology is essential when you have a complex matrix portfolio of Global, Regional and Local Brands. From experience we know our VIVID system has the flexibility to be configured to provide the right level of support. VIVID is an easy-to-use, quickly implemented marketing technology platform and can evolve with your changing needs. It eliminates confusing email threads with lots of participants, dispersed assets, massive email attachments and bottlenecks in workflows. All of which underpin that ability to maintain creative excellence and brand consistency.VIVID delivers reduced time and costs to activate campaigns, greater control and increased transparency and brand consistency. Key elements VIVID that offers include: Approval and workflows, Asset Management, Budget Tracking, Briefing, Delivery, Reporting.\n\nIn addition, VIVID integrates with best-in-breed programs, includes a templated system for automated creative deliverables and has security and access rights set according to each user/user group. Our approach to transcreation also helps ensure brand consistency through the integration of technology and people. Our vendor management linguist selection process ensures we use only the best in market linguists and copywriters per market. We then create tailored and bespoke localization workflows, and combine these with intelligent enabling technologies that are scaled and integrated specifically to our clients\u2019 localization needs. Throughout the localization process, with the leverage of previously translated assets through translation memory, together with web-based terminology databases and proofing systems, we then ensure ongoing brand consistency across markets.\", nan\nCreative, nan, How can you support the optimization of digital campaigns inflight? (optimization of banners,social etc), In Jellyfish\u2019s experience, delivery of in-flight campaign optimisation requires good collaboration between all parties involved and optimum planning. It\u2019s a very specific requirement that needs to be structured into the operational approach. As your partner, Jellyfish anticipates working with your selected media agency and your digital marketing teams to ensure campaign goals and KPIs are structured for success. Our philosophy is to build a customer journey, not isolated creative formats. This means we optimise inherently by making the most of common media formats and mapping types of creative by objective. We can use dynamic creative to streamline your current workflow, add production efficiencies and optimise on the fly. We therefore recommend structuring smart creative capability in the following areas:\n\nOrganisation: Setting the organisation up to be able to optimise is the best chance of success. We would review with you how you currently setup and implement digital campaigns, including the pain points. The typical campaign setup process involves: media strategy, creative brief, creative production, feed customisation (if dynamic creative is required), data platform", "doc_id": "b3c83f95-d830-47fd-b33d-a1acaad1f2cf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7996513655f92a04788adff5373e4549623398d74d71e4be1b9ed854b3f21c26", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 16615, "end": 21004}, "relationships": {"1": "3feaa22b-6b84-4df5-8b40-4f2af44844a1", "2": "43412d41-029a-46d5-88ea-fde0648d7e40", "3": "ba9b413f-d2fd-44b1-93c5-d6aa93714fa5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba9b413f-d2fd-44b1-93c5-d6aa93714fa5": {"__data__": {"text": "media agency and your digital marketing teams to ensure campaign goals and KPIs are structured for success.

We would review with you how you currently setup and implement digital campaigns, including the pain points. The typical campaign setup process involves: media strategy, creative brief, creative production, feed customisation (if dynamic creative is required), data platform integrations, creative decisioning logic, extensive QA, and reporting/analysis. Outcomes from this planning would be the identification of clear roles and responsibilities, clarity around data access and a workflow plan.\n\nPeople: Based on the scope of work, and a roles and responsibilities definition output from the organization review, we would deploy the right mix of talent covering management, planning, ad operations oversight, creative production and analytics to ensure quality of messaging architecture and creative templates are in place for each campaign. As we have described previously, sensitivity to creative output is a major part of our culture at Jellyfish. We have deep experience of managing fast turn campaign development and optimisation, working with media partners and adserving technologies to make it happen.\n\nFor each campaign, we would be briefed on the primary objective and the specific goals required, and build a systemic approach to optimisation built in to the deployment. We\u2019d need to understand what \u2018good performance\u2019 means to you \u2013 is it to generate a specific action, what would that look like and how would we quantify or qualify that action? We would then build a campaign mapping approach by objective audience and channel, a messaging architecture decision tree and creative templates. We will define the campaign optimisation decision tree, working with the media partner to identify the signals necessary to trigger the right messaging \u2013 for example scheduled promotions (eg a retailer specific activity) or brand messages related to events (the big lunch weekender or a baking competition on TV) real time offers (win trip to Legoland if you register today). We recommend a simple IFTT decision tree approach. We optimise the campaign based on audience segments and signals, ensuring the right creative is served at the right time. Using a creative template that can be dynamic with a defined set of variables, we adjust messages efficiently across a range of criteria relevant to the brand and campaign creative. At a simple level, this allows for easy retargeting in programmatic. Jellyfish is currently the dynamic creative production partner for Nike EMEA where we produce creative templates at all levels of the funnel and across social channels.\n\nTechnology: Optimisation of campaigns requires us to have insight into and access to the tech stack across the agency ecosystem to design integrations and reporting for the best operating system to improve campaigns in flight. As your partner, we would anticipate an open and collaborative discussion with the client and your media agency(ies). This is important to clarify roles and responsibilities: who holds the data, who defines audiences and so on. Examples of technology are ad serving platforms, social platform integration tools, attribution, viewability. AB and MVT (Multivariate testing) functionality can to be handled via the dynamic creative platform or the adserver so we can optimise in flight. We can provide guidance on how best to work with the social platforms, drawing on our experience of developing content campaigns (both paid and organic). The client may well have social publishing tools in place (hootsuite or sprinklr et al) or may utilise native platforms (Facebook ad manager) to push social posts and reporting but it depends on the scale and ambition of your social activity and who runs it currently.

As your partner our objective would be to establish an operating system for advertising execution where data delivers competitive advantage and supports efficiency. Performance optimization per se is really one part of the bigger picture, and we would anticipate having good working relationships with your selected media agencies to enable the flow of data into a central planning capability. Jellyfish can support you in designing this function or we can share responsibilities with media. We recommend defining a strategy along the following lines.\n\n1. Using data to develop creative \nAs part of the briefing, our insight team can support smarter objective setting by audiences using a variety of planning tools. Depending on budget appetite for data and the scope of work, we can use detailed audience profiling (Experian et al) to Establish segments. We\u2019d like to understand overlaps with the data you have and the data you could have on your audience. We\u2019d expect to work with your media agency to define these segments and understand their behaviours at key points in the funnel, based on actions. As a start point, who shops, visited a lifestyle or recipe site, these targeting possibilities in certain social media can be highly specific and related to brand characteristics and behaviour. In social channels we can develop audiences against characteristics and previous behaviours, using custom and lookalike audience\n\n2. Using data to make campaigns more effective\nThis area is where we need to connect effectively with the client\u2019s own data strategy media partner and consequent ad \u00a0serving technology stack. As your partner, we can offer guidance on an approach to dynamic campaigns and programmatic (where campaigns can be automated). Examples of this include dynamic maps to add geo location for promotions; audience matching in Facebook; adding dynamic content to digital display and social content; creating dynamic rotation in digital out of home; creating dynamic content based on segmentation and location triggers; location based messaging. Outcomes of these campaign actions can driving footfall to a sampling location; improve engagement rates; in every instance connecting data and creative to bring commercial benefit.\nData we would use to deliver a high level of optimisation, in simplest terms, - would be\n- who we are targeting: audience segmentations (personae)\n- where they are: platform eg iOS, Android, [CLIENT], Social platform, other digital network;\n- when they should be served content: date, time, weather, geo triggers, other platform behaviours/ retargeting pattern\n- what content they are served (see ad planning decision tree model above in previous answer).\n\nJellyfish will support the client as required in collecting data from public (or contracted) services and deliver in a client defined format. This would include data collection and update; data enrichment and enhancement; data validation and verification; monitoring; maintenance real time data monitoring services that include continuous monitoring of various sites on a regular basis\n\n3. Using data for reporting and analytics\nAs your partner we would expect to be able to provide a level of reporting that supports business performance and is easy to use and understand. The modern trend to dashboarding key data so senior management can that see KPIs are being tracked and met requires good access to a range of data sources.

Depending on the scope of our engagement, we can structure a reporting dashboard that provides as deep a level of reporting as you need.\n\nData sources for reporting will depend on the scope and scale of the engagement \u2013 specifically delivering campaign performance would require access to the DMP, DSP, adserving platform and social analytics (can be native on the platform or integrated into the ad server reporting function.) Campaign analytics can of course be set up to be realtime \u2013 enabling us to make changes or optimise creatives in channel, during the campaign lifecycle.\n\nTypical analytics frameworks report on all industry standard cross channel metrics (clicks, conversions, frequency, interaction, video, etc.) and content optimisation specific metrics. We can process data at intervals required by client\u2019s digital campaign stakeholders eg 24 hr, weekly etc) and is available via fully a configurable user interface, or by scheduled email delivery, API or even log file data transfer. Ultimately, as your creative production partners, we will support you to create a future state digital campaign engine that has intelligence and optimisation built into the system.\n, nan\nData & Analytics, nan, In the ever evolving landscape of consumer privacy, how do you help clients navigate perspectives on consumer and brand protection?, We have created category specific privacy playbooks that are regularly updated and cover these guiding principles\n\nVision - What levers do we want to use in marketing, and in order to do so what do we only need to collect to make the right decisions and create experiences for consumers with a reasonable value exchange.\nProcess - How do we adopt the correct consent management processes, implement appropriate tracking and focus on non pii focused methods for analysis and planning.\nExecution - How to use the right solutions in tech to aid the modelling to fill in the data gaps so that we can be confident in the decisions we take.\n\nThere has never been such a thing as perfect data and never will be, however, we would run regular workshops with you to ensure you are up to date with the possibilities that technology allows you to act in the appropriate way. We don\u2019t provide legal counsel but are adept at highlighting how to capture what you need or where you can use trend data instead. We have a talented team of CRM and Analytics experts working side by side with media teams to give you an unrivaled view of how this is impacting our industry.\n\nWe have also developed a range of social media listening and media transparency tools to ensure your brand stays safe and current.

Suitable assets are then recommended for specific optimizations based on channel and format best practices and then introduced into a strategic testing framework designed to uncover brand-specific takeaways. This process is then repeated frequently, on short, iterative cycles to ensure that the A/B testing learnings are being applied in a meaningful manner, that all creative possibilities are being explored and that the full potential of each and every asset is maximized when it comes to performance, reach, and ROI. Following this approach allows our clients to get the most out of their creative budgets and overall investment in creative assets.  , nan\nMedia & SEO, nan, If relevant, what is your approach to testing TV and Radio creative?

Key components of understanding a business include:\n  - data access and ownership - does the client have access to their 1st party data and how can that be leveraged across media executions?\n  - tagging - what is currently tagged on all owned and operated properties? \n  - measurement - how is success being defined? what limitations are currently being encountered that need to be addressed for growth?\n\nDesign - after the Discovery phase, we can then look to design a media plan that centers around the goals, builds from previous successes, and strategicially navigates from the challenges so that the execution is designed to succeed. Some elements of Design include:\n  - identifying 1st party data segments available that can be deployed across various platforms\n  - selecting platforms that make the most sense to find our key customers and developing our full-year activation strategy that accounts for seasonlity and fluctuations in the market\n  - setting up a measurement framework that accounts for the walled gardens and still", "doc_id": "486abaa2-8980-4012-874b-c761f344efec", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e4323e5aabd31d6bcee7f88c78f05c39c5ca4927aca46aec207dba143723e744", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 116667, "end": 121096}, "relationships": {"1": "3feaa22b-6b84-4df5-8b40-4f2af44844a1", "2": "439cfbac-0ea7-4a4d-9b6d-5c0de0070d9d", "3": "1563ecb8-bcca-4b67-9abc-11b551b73c44"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1563ecb8-bcca-4b67-9abc-11b551b73c44": {"__data__": {"text": " - tagging - what is currently tagged on all owned and operated properties? \n  - measurement - how is success being defined? what limitations are currently being encountered that need to be addressed for growth?\n\nDesign - after the Discovery phase, we can then look to design a media plan that centers around the goals, builds from previous successes, and strategicially navigates from the challenges so that the execution is designed to succeed.

And, if a website is down, SafetyNet pauses the paid media activity. \nWe have automated reports distributed to the Jellyfish Walden team daily, at multiple times during the day (but at the same time each day) so that we can spot anomalies. , Oct 2021\nIndustry Experience, nan, What is an example of how you leverage your close relationships with the media community to ensure priority access to first mover and/or category exclusive media opportunities., We have built close relationships with the media community - media owners and platforms - and base those relationships on a foundation of great work.  Partners trust  Jellyfish\u2019s exceptional execution and implementation skills in digital media, as well as our responsiveness and core value of \u201cbeing the solution.\u201d   \n\nWe are preferred partners for many media owners, including Google (Premier Partner) and Facebook (Premium Partner).  As a Google Premier Partner, Jellyfish frequently tests first-to-market Alpha and Beta products. Our first-mover opportunities with Google have included Custom Algorithms in DBM, Brand Lift 2.0 measurement solutions for YouTube, In-Banner Live Streaming Ads, and Conversion Lift Tests in AdWords, among others.  \n\nWe have co-developed a number tools and extensions that enhance the capabilities of our media and technology partners, and ultimately provide unique advantages to our clients.   In addition, we serve as consultants to our preferred partners to advise on emerging trends, market adoption, and feature development, influencing the prioritization of key initiatives.\n\n Jellyfish has partnered with Facebook as a participant in the beta test for Instagram Discovery ads.  Additionally, through our close relationships with Google and other major programmatic partners.  Jellyfish gets a first look at major industry updates such as Google\u2019s FLoC and TheTradeDesk\u2019s UID2 solutions., Oct 2021\nMartech & Adtech, nan, What are the steps/ processes taken for data validation and quality assurance ? Please highlight any automated processes, Jellyfish utilizes Google Cloud Platform for data quality and validation. This will primarily be facilitating feeds into BigQuery via Data Flow or native integrations (e.g. GA360), applying validation logic, and setting a virtual machine to run this daily. This must be automated from data collection to validation and alerting. We find quality assurance issues occur most often wherever manual interventions are used, so Jellyfish keeps those processes completely automated.  We have dedicated QA testers to ensure our workflow meets both the functional and non-functional requirements. From the data analytics side, we employ rigorous testing steps leveraging various testing methodologies that inspect data issues related to missing data, invalid data sets, illegal data formats, data partition issues, data mismatching, duplication, etc.\n\nWe have developed extensive workflows to support QA of all platform implementation, tagging requirements, and media activations.   Automated audit tools and technologies, building on top of the platform APIs, are used to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of the audit processes.  We\u2019ve developed platform extensions leveraging appscript and python to automate and drive scale in the workflows required to traffic and launch media campaigns.

In addition,  user management and access control for media and technology platforms are handled through a specialized technical team to ensure governance and authorization.\n, Oct 2021\nMartech & Adtech, nan, Can automated alerts be set-up for any problems?, Automated alerts can be implemented directly within many of our activation and analytics platforms, as well as through the use of our proprietary tools.  Examples of metrics that can benefit from alert automation are pacing, performance KPIs, approvals/rejections, and site activities.\n\nAlerts can also be configured based on validation criteria defined within BigQuery. These alerts will be via email as standard but can be extended to other means (e.g. SMS). Block Lists and Negative Keyword lists can be adjusted in platforms based on email alerts for breaking news events.\n\nAs also mentioned in Question 4b, Jellyfish developed SafetyNet. SafetyNet is an automated early warning system that continually checks your paid search activity for any performance anomalies and critical errors that could result in downtime or wasted spend. \n\nLink\n, Oct 2021\nMartech & Adtech, nan, Does your agency actively Black-List sites and networks?, \nJellyfish prides itself on a multi-layered approach when it comes to vetting all supply sources and inventory partnerships.  Blocklisting both sites and ad networks is a vital part of this process, and because of this, we are constantly updating these lists to fit client needs. Jellyfish maintains standardized blocklists, which are applied in addition to custom blocklists created in coordination with client brand suitability guidelines. Adjustments to a client blocklist are made for several reasons, including performance, fraudulent activity, or content not meeting client expectations and/or values. We also leverage 3rd party vendor verification tools to help provide insight and guidance into how we make decisions around blocklisting., Oct 2021\nMartech & Adtech, nan, How do you account for Bot Traffic and ad Fraud? Which Ad Fraud tool do you partner with?, As part of our Jellyfish Supply Optimization approach, Invalid Traffic (IVT) and Brand Safety audits are regularly carried out to ensure all inventory being purchased by Jellyfish is legitimate and of appropriate quality. Using activation platform settings in combination with MRC accredited vendors, we can closely monitor and identify any publishers pushing inventory with high levels of bot traffic and ad fraud and add these sites to our blocklists. Daily checks, as well as monthly brand-specific deep dives, allow us to ensure that we maintain extremely insignificant levels of IVT. \n\nIAB\u2019s ads.txt protocol is also used as standard practice to further ensure the prevention of bot traffic and ad fraud, increasing transparency for our clients, and providing confidence in the authenticity of the inventory we purchase.\n\nJellyfish has expertise across major ad fraud and viewability vendors depending on existing client relationships, with our preferred partner recommendation of Integral Ad Science (IAS)., Oct 2021\nMartech & Adtech, nan, Please indicate any other data validation or quality assurance capabilities?, We approach data validation and quality assurance in three areas:\n\nData validation: We have extensive processes developed from data collection to data validation and data processing.

Smaller spend optimizations can be tracked in shared, client-facing change logs illustrating our \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d tweaks and adjustments in the service of standard campaign performance. Ongoing performance optimizations can be and are often shared as part of regular reporting updates. Larger recommendations and changes are done in consultations with client teams - rebalancing spend between channels or creative/messaging optimization. \n, Oct 2021\nMedia Reporting, nan, To what extent are media costs and serving (impressions) included in reports?, i. Actual media cost\nii. Network Level\niii. Site Level\niv. Page Level\nTransparency and accessibility are thematic to the way we partner with our clients, spanning from strategic direction through to granular reporting of all platform and media metrics. Media economics and costs, as well as data on the Network/Site/Page level, are each fully disclosed and can be presented in reporting formats as necessary, or pushed to a cloud storage solution. \n\nBeyond access, the expertise of our media and data teams will uncover trends, insights, and optimization opportunities from the wealth of granular data. These findings and tactical recommendations are the focus of our communication and reporting cadence, while the raw data is made available for analysis or validation.\n, Oct 2021\nPricing, nan, Have you worked with clients in an incentive-based payment model? What elements of service were incentivized? What sort of reporting was required to power that model? What were the benefits and weaknesses of that approach?, Yes, we have worked in an incentivize-based payment model. We found it better to incentivize the entire activity, from a tracking and performance perspective, than to break down certain elements.\n\nWhatever the KPIs to be paid off of, we would require the data underlying that. \n\nBenefits\n- Aligns our interests, whatever is your most important metric(s), we will be measured on the same and paid incentives for achieving / exceeding.\n\nWeaknesses\n- It is never simple. \n- Marketing is rarely 1 or 2 key metrics, it is typically a combination. Both trials AND paying customers are important metrics for HBO Max. If we are incentivized on just 1, it is possible to not deliver on the 2nd. \n- CPAs are typical targets, though the cleanliness and effectiveness of CPAs can often depend on the overall media mix, the mix of trials, and new customers. , Oct 2021\nIndustry Experience, nan, What is your agency\u2019s POV on the movement towards consumer privacy and \u201ccookie-less\u201d future?, Our POV at Jellyfish is two-fold.

First, we recognize and support the shift in consumer privacy trending towards greater individual control over personal data.  Second, despite Google delaying its plans to phase out third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, we advocate that brands actively plan and test to be ready for this world and to be able to innovate and thrive relative to competitors. \n\nRegulatory and technical changes are directed this way as privacy laws are introduced globally and browsers/operating systems deprecate support for tracking and individual user identification. This means that media and technical strategies need to address several challenges:\n\nData Collection Challenges \nWith more fragmented ecosystems, it will be harder to get a complete overview of consumer\u2019s lifecycle\nCurrent global data collection frameworks will not meet local legal compliance requirements\n\nMeasurement Challenges\nConversion tracking will be limited and will not represent your business\u2019 reality\nAttribution models will under evaluate media performances, especially on display & video campaigns\nUser-level incrementality protocols will no longer be reliable to identify performance levers\n\nActivation Challenges\nTargeting using both First and Third party audiences will see significant drops in addressable audience \nPersonalization that relies on cookie-derived audiences will fail\nProduct level remarketing (or 1:1) personalization will be limited \n\nTo address these challenges, we recommend a \u201cprivacy by design\u201d approach. \nThis is an opportunity for brands to rethink their approach to digital marketing and implement innovative and privacy-preserving strategies to leverage their first-party data while fostering consumer trust.  Privacy is an inherent component of any strategy to facilitate transparent, data-driven marketing.\n\nAs your  digital partner, we\u2019ll provide strategic and technical insights to enable you to best reconcile digital marketing performance and privacy compliance.  We are expert and agnostic, and are able to support you with all digital marketing processes involving data, from consent management and data collection to attribution, insights and activation.  \n\nUsing this approach, we\u2019ll help you to determine and collect the metrics that matter, leverage technology to build a unified, privacy compliant measurement framework, bridge the gap with durable first party measurement, and embrace consent management. \n, Oct 2021\nAccount Management, nan, Please outline the dedicated team we would have for our account. \nHow do you decide what type of team we get?

To counter this we have created a Market Intelligence capability at Jellyfish responsible for providing our internal teams with a market-oriented perspective of consumers and competitors to fuel insights and strategy. This team is an element of our Platform Planning Process, but remains separate from our Media and Brand Strategy capabilities to ensure that media perspectives and institutional brand knowledge do not cloud our judgment in planning effectively for your true consumers.

At Jellyfish, we believe it is critical for mobile optimisation to be able to consolidate data from across the client\u2019s MMP, their in-app analytics partner (eg Firebase, Amplitude), partner side platforms (Facebook, Google, Apple), and any mCRM platforms (eg Braze). A visualization tool like Google Data Studios or Tableau, a data pipeline tool like Funnel.io, and cloud platform instance with a dedicated workspace for Jellyfish to perform analysis - are all vital elements for such reporting.\n\n\nAssuming this is in place, we will be able to connect marketing spend at the channel and campaign level, to the LTV or ROI represented at the in-app event level, and hence able to take the right decisions on media investment and budget allocation. For example, utilizing Apple Search Ads on its own will only allow us to track campaigns to the cost per install.

Consolidated reporting of historical performance data thus becomes even more important in providing us with a baseline from which we can model future campaigns.\n\nSpecifically regarding retention metrics, we have a variety of strategies:\nFor metrics such as day 7, day 14, day 30 usage volumes, we can analyse campaigns by cohorted view, to understand which tactics are contributing to more highly retained users, and optimise accordingly.\n\nFor retention understood as re-engaged users, we can create specific audience segments within either the MMP or platforms such as Google or social, and then run campaigns targeting these specific segments, measured on cost per action, based on MMP data.\n\nTo join up mobile acquisition with wider marketing activity, utilising a partner like Braze will enable seamless messaging from marketing, to email, to push notifications, allowing us to enhance communication with our target users, and improve our retention of customers., June 2022 Yahoo RFI\nDiversity and inclusion, nan, Please describe how you integrate the concepts of \u2018DEI\u2019 and \u2018Universal Inclusion\u2019 into how you hire, develop and retain agency talent, how you conduct research and develop insights, and how you develop media and channel plans., Our recruitment policies and business processes amplify the voice of people from underrepresented communities in the industry, by positioning our belief in equal employment opportunities and our value of the impact that diverse representation has on developing creative and innovative solutions.

Jellyfish does things a little differently. We have a one Jellyfish structure, truly flat teams that recognize individuals who excel internally and/or externally. Unconscious bias is removed, decisions are based on outcomes and performance data, majority related to their role, sometimes not, promoting greatness across the team, not just in the superstars who naturally are in the limelight. More than 800 employees have been promoted since the grading structure was introduced, 51% of whom are women.\n\nRemoving unconscious bias from the process has helped the firm to recognize a more diverse array of talents. We distribute the accountability, we don\u2019t delegate it. Whoever\u2019s best placed to carry out a piece of work does so, cutting out any hierarchical layers in between. All of which means that line managers, in a traditional sense, are surplus to requirements. We have culturally adapted it to regions where it may not fit, for example in India, utilizing a group to help an individual due to it being culturally frowned upon to boast about an idea, initiative or input from oneself.\n\nOur vision for diversity and inclusion is to create an environment that allows all Jellies to bring their true self to work, by promoting and investing in training and educational opportunities, raising awareness and providing strategies and tools to create a sustainable culture of inclusion, belonging, and equity that permeates through our employee and client experiences.

We also recognize that in order to differentiate a brand\u2019s approach in SEM auctions, we must make the most of the business intelligence held within the brand. To do this, we have data experts who work with our clients to manipulate customer, sales, product and location data into our bidding platforms. This allows us to pivot the SEM campaigns in different ways to provide even more signals to bid with.  \n\nWe are technology agnostic and manage campaigns to a high level of performance through many SEM platforms, depending on our client\u2019s preference. We primarily use Search Ads 360 as our SEM bid management platform of choice.  We also developed our own proprietary technology, called SafetyNet, that monitors SEM activity and alerts the team when critical performance anomalies occur. As an example, SafetyNet will automatically pause SEM activity if your website goes down and resumes activity when the website service returns. This was a small flaw in native, rule-based alerts with most SEM platforms that we took the initiative to correct. , nan\nMedia & SEO, nan,    How does your agency develop keyword lists, and make recommendations on potential adjustments of expansions?, We use a mixture of automated and manual methods for building out keyword lists.

While our keywords are active, we consistently mine raw search term reports for new keyword opportunities, as well as negative keywords that need to be applied. Our automated keyword mining solutions helps to streamline this process when building both positive and negative keyword lists. \n\nWe have also used Inventory Keyword Campaigns where applicable through Search Ads 360, which uses the information from product feeds to create keywords, ads, and ad groups. These campaigns dynamically update based on the product feed. For example, if a price changes in the product feed, ad copy updates automatically. Furthermore, if a product is listed as out of stock within the feed, keywords and ads for that specific product would automatically be paused. \n\nTo maintain keyword lists, we go through multiple processes to achieve different outcomes. We establish a set of top performing Priority keywords, for which we receive alerts whenever there are performance anomalies. We constantly review user journeys across devices for these terms to ensure optimal positioning and CPC range.

We operate a fully front office team, so our clients have access to the experts they need. We connect our teams to clients own teams rather than separate front and back office function slowing down projects and progress.

We\u2019re interested in understanding your processes for talent, workflow management, governance, etc across many brands & many markets.\nWhat challenges have you seen?\n\nWhat opportunities exist for marketers\n, We have worked with a number of clients who are considered a house of brands, including Deckers, PVH, and The Hut Group. There are obvious challenges which we navigate with clients who have a portfolio of brands, and the many ways in which those brands can require different approaches - scale, maturity, awareness, audience and customer overlap and prioritisation, internal stakeholders and structures to name a few.  Our core focus with these type of clients has been to ensure that the service, performance, innovation and dedication is as equal amongst the group as possible.\n\nWhilst larger spending brands may seem like they need the balance of time, there is often bigger market headroom and significant gains to be had amongst smaller rapid growth brands. As part of our onboarding process we will make a full maturity assessment of brand, market and consumer to produce not only growth plans but ascertain the maturity of the marketing outputs. \n\nOn a tactical level, we have found we can quickly make gains by changes in things like ad-tech account structures, KPI and measurement frameworks or media investments. With the brands\u2019 media investments it is critical to understand how each is seen in market audience and product cross-over, with the creation of rules in media platforms based on the sales volumes per brand we are looking to achieve. \n\nThe biggest opportunity with a house of brands used to be all about data sharing and promoting a single customer view at a group level.

How do you advise clients on best practices to develop creative in order to maximize incremental sales?, When it comes to driving incremental sales and ad performance on FB/IG, we lean heavily on working to feed the algorithm with the right signals and allowing it to optimise. We couple this with a robust 'test and learn' methodology so we know what is actually driving incremental sales. For example we've used conversion path analysis to uncover the incremental impact FB/IG traffic was having on conversions compared to other channels. \n\nWe know that around 60% of the performance across FB/IG is driven by creative. We work closely with our Creative and Experience teams to understand the elements that drive effectiveness - we then take the results and recommendations to clients to action in campaigns going forward. We also use our Premium Agency partner badge to learn from Meta what is driving best practice across all categories that we can apply to our clients\n, Peloton July 2022\nMedia & SEO, nan, What experience and best practices do you advise your clients on for short-form social video, UGC and influencer content?, In our experience, short form social video UGC must have the brand first, ideally with the logo (or distinctive brand asset) front and centre. If possible all assets should have the product in the spotlight. The video should work without sound. When working with an influencer, we see best results when the content is amplified with media spend.

Jellyfish works directly with TikTok's Creative Exchange program on behalf of clients.

If not, what is your process if/and when needed?, Jellyfish is not currently a SAG-AFTRA signatory, as we reserve the right to work with union and non union crew worldwide. SAG's contract may restrict what is possible for us, and open us up to legal challenges if we work with non union or SAG actors outside of the signatory terms going forward.\n\nSAG projects/ workaround:\nWhen working on productions where we hire SAG actors directly, or for when SAG talent is mandated by the client for larger productions, we choose to work with 3rd party production companies who are SAG signatories.\nWhen working on SAG projects with 3rd party production companies who are signatories, we set a production only budget for the shoot component of the project. That budget is what the production company uses to pay everyone associated with the project, from actors to writers, etc. that they have contracted.\n\nNon SAG Projects:\nWhen working with non SAG talent, we are able to choose a direct in house production route, or 3rd party production companies based on the requirements of the project.\n\nEven though Jellyfish is not a union signatory, when we hire non-union actors, we still endeavour to treat the actors ethically, pay them reasonably, and only have to negotiate the terms directly with with the talent (and sometimes their agents). Usage, territories, media, residuals and buy-outs, etc. are negotiated directly. This simplifies the workflow and record keeping and we often find for below the line advertising, non union actors still provide a great talent pool., nan\nRelationships, nan, W+K, We\u2019ve been working with W+K LDN on print production since 2010, mainly covering Honda and Sainsbury\u2019s.

Please detail. \nWhat do you put in place to face the current talent shortage in the industry?\n, We have put our answers for these two questions together as we view them as equally important. How we attract, retain and navigate industry issues, all stems from how our business has been built, the recognition that our people are lifeblood and key to our and our clients success.\n\nFrom the creation of The Brandtech Group we wanted there to be a difference in the social contract we had with our employees. For us, getting it right in the value we offer to the team is the biggest factor in determining the success of our clients and therefore our business. We set ourselves up for success by placing our people first, they are our most valuable asset. \n\nWe have thrown out the traditional hierarchy, that agencies are supposed to be structured, interact and promote in a certain way. The Brandtech Group does things a little differently. We have a one company structure, truly flat teams that recognize individuals who excel internally and/or externally. Unconscious bias is removed, decisions are based on outcomes and performance data, majority related to their role, sometimes not, promoting greatness across the team, not just in the superstars who naturally are in the limelight. More than 800 employees have been promoted since the grading structure was introduced, 57% of whom are women. Removing unconscious bias from the process has helped the firm to recognize a more diverse array of talents. We distribute the accountability, we don\u2019t delegate it. Whoever\u2019s best placed to carry out a piece of work does so, cutting out any hierarchical layers in between. All of which means that line managers, in a traditional sense, are surplus to requirements. We have culturally adapted it to regions where it may not fit, for example in India, utilizing a group to help an individual due to it being culturally frowned upon to boast about an idea, initiative or input from oneself.\n\nBreaking down the barriers and escaping the onerous traditional hierarchical tasks means freeing individuals to make the contributions they are able to make, and progress according to their own goals and achievement. Removing unconscious bias from the process has helped the business to recognize a more diverse array of talents. As we promote and enable individuals across the business with very diverse and differentiated skill sets, we have seen innovation prosper. Giving people the time and freedom to develop ideas has meant that we have seen huge leaps in the solutions we are developing for clients and partners. Incremental gains have become the minimum.\n\nOur JF Academy - now in its 18th instance - will come to APAC in January 23, with 22 roles open across Australia, India, Japan, and Korea.This consists of an 8 week training programme across data & media where team members will be fully paid.

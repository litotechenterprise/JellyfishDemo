Company Overview,,Describe your philosophy and process for working across agency office locations and P&Ls.,Jellyfish is unique in having a single global P&L which allows us to manage all our work in the client's best interest. This means in practical terms that we will use any appropriate resource from across our network to complete projects. ,
Relationships,,Does your company normally coordinate with creative agencies in the production management process? What is the best practice for ensuring the hand-off is seamless?,"Collaboration is in our DNA at Jellyfish. We work with hundreds of creative, media, design and other agencies on a daily basis. In our experience, the best way to manage these relationships is for the client to be very clear about who does what and what the handover points are. Often we work closely with client marketing and procurement personnel to determine these from the outset of our engagement. Our contacts range from in-house Client Brand Managers to direct relationships with agency teams and suppliers on behalf of our clients – often working to ensure the seamless delivery of a global campaign. Some client quotes from a recent client survey undertaken by a third party at our request serve to underline this.

“...they had seamlessly managed to integrate working in quite a difficult situation between client and creative agency and keep both sets of people happy, deliver the work and not upset the agency or the relationship that the client has with the agency.” “...it would be very easy for a normal production agency to tread on people’s toes too much, but they have managed it very well indeed”. 

Our VIVID workflow and approval platform underpins this ability to work collaboratively with multiple entities.

Creative,,"How do we maintain the highest level of creative excellence, brand consistency and continue to deliver distinctive assets across the different brands?","""In Jellyfish’s experience, the key to maintaining creative excellence, brand consistency and efficient delivery of distinctive assets across a diverse portfolio relies on four key elements of Organization, People, Process and Technology:

Organization: The overall marketing organization, and in particular who is responsible for relationships between internal teams, third party agencies and the associated hand-offs, approval processes and overall governance framework need to be clear. This establishes the framework within which great work can be created efficiently.

People: You need to ensure you have the right people in place both within the agencies you are working with and respectfully within your own organization. By the ‘right people’ we mean those who are collaborative, open to learning, have strong team ethic and creatively driven. Everyone needs to understand their role and responsibilities and how they personally add value in order to effectively deliver creative excellence consistently. The setting of KPIs helps drive the right behaviors. A spirit of transparency needs to be encouraged between agencies to ensure successful collaboration.

Process: It’s vital to have a process that is clear and understood by all parties. At the start of the engagement, an induction and onboarding process is required. In addition as on large and complex pieces of business, staff turnover is inevitable, so it’s crucial to ensure there is an ongoing induction process in place for any new people that subsequently join the team. This should be for both client and agency representatives. Another aspect Jellyfish likes to see embedded in any process is the use of regular ‘wash-up’ sessions. It also pays dividends to have a process to widely disseminate learnings and to ensure best practice is being constantly shared. This can be managed simply, for example via a monthly update email to the team/s.

Technology: Supporting your people and processes with the right ‘fit for purpose’ and easy to use technology is essential when you have a complex matrix portfolio of Global, Regional and Local Brands. From experience we know our VIVID system has the flexibility to be configured to provide the right level of support. VIVID is an easy-to-use, quickly implemented marketing technology platform and can evolve with your changing needs. It eliminates confusing email threads with lots of participants, dispersed assets, massive email attachments and bottlenecks in workflows. All of which underpin that ability to maintain creative excellence and brand consistency.VIVID delivers reduced time and costs to activate campaigns, greater control and increased transparency and brand consistency. Key elements VIVID that offers include: Approval and workflows, Asset Management, Budget Tracking, Briefing, Delivery, Reporting.

In addition, VIVID integrates with best-in-breed programs, includes a templated system for automated creative deliverables and has security and access rights set according to each user/user group. Our approach to transcreation also helps ensure brand consistency through the integration of technology and people. Our vendor management linguist selection process ensures we use only the best in market linguists and copywriters per market. We then create tailored and bespoke localization workflows, and combine these with intelligent enabling technologies that are scaled and integrated specifically to our clients’ localization needs. Throughout the localization process, with the leverage of previously translated assets through translation memory, together with web-based terminology databases and proofing systems, we then ensure ongoing brand consistency across markets.""",
Creative,,"How can you support the optimization of digital campaigns inflight? (optimization of banners,social etc)","In Jellyfish’s experience, delivery of in-flight campaign optimisation requires good collaboration between all parties involved and optimum planning. It’s a very specific requirement that needs to be structured into the operational approach. As your partner, Jellyfish anticipates working with your selected media agency and your digital marketing teams to ensure campaign goals and KPIs are structured for success. Our philosophy is to build a customer journey, not isolated creative formats. This means we optimise inherently by making the most of common media formats and mapping types of creative by objective. We can use dynamic creative to streamline your current workflow, add production efficiencies and optimise on the fly. We therefore recommend structuring smart creative capability in the following areas:

Organisation: Setting the organisation up to be able to optimise is the best chance of success. We would review with you how you currently setup and implement digital campaigns, including the pain points. The typical campaign setup process involves: media strategy, creative brief, creative production, feed customisation (if dynamic creative is required), data platform integrations, creative decisioning logic, extensive QA, and reporting/analysis. Outcomes from this planning would be the identification of clear roles and responsibilities, clarity around data access and a workflow plan.

People: Based on the scope of work, and a roles and responsibilities definition output from the organization review, we would deploy the right mix of talent covering management, planning, ad operations oversight, creative production and analytics to ensure quality of messaging architecture and creative templates are in place for each campaign. As we have described previously, sensitivity to creative output is a major part of our culture at Jellyfish. We have deep experience of managing fast turn campaign development and optimisation, working with media partners and adserving technologies to make it happen.

For each campaign, we would be briefed on the primary objective and the specific goals required, and build a systemic approach to optimisation built in to the deployment. We’d need to understand what ‘good performance’ means to you – is it to generate a specific action, what would that look like and how would we quantify or qualify that action? We would then build a campaign mapping approach by objective audience and channel, a messaging architecture decision tree and creative templates. We will define the campaign optimisation decision tree, working with the media partner to identify the signals necessary to trigger the right messaging – for example scheduled promotions (eg a retailer specific activity) or brand messages related to events (the big lunch weekender or a baking competition on TV) real time offers (win trip to Legoland if you register today). We recommend a simple IFTT decision tree approach. We optimise the campaign based on audience segments and signals, ensuring the right creative is served at the right time. Using a creative template that can be dynamic with a defined set of variables, we adjust messages efficiently across a range of criteria relevant to the brand and campaign creative. At a simple level, this allows for easy retargeting in programmatic. Jellyfish is currently the dynamic creative production partner for Nike EMEA where we produce creative templates at all levels of the funnel and across social channels.

Technology: Optimisation of campaigns requires us to have insight into and access to the tech stack across the agency ecosystem to design integrations and reporting for the best operating system to improve campaigns in flight. As your partner, we would anticipate an open and collaborative discussion with the client and your media agency(ies). This is important to clarify roles and responsibilities: who holds the data, who defines audiences and so on. Examples of technology are ad serving platforms, social platform integration tools, attribution, viewability. AB and MVT (Multivariate testing) functionality can to be handled via the dynamic creative platform or the adserver so we can optimise in flight. We can provide guidance on how best to work with the social platforms, drawing on our experience of developing content campaigns (both paid and organic). The client may well have social publishing tools in place (hootsuite or sprinklr et al) or may utilise native platforms (Facebook ad manager) to push social posts and reporting but it depends on the scale and ambition of your social activity and who runs it currently. This is a separate task to the VIVID marketing operations technology we would deploy for the client, but the two are of course related as we can develop campaign plans and content using VIVID and deploy creative assets to third parties via an API.",

Creative,,Provide an example of a project you’ve executed that streamlined the creative process under tight timelines while maintaining collaboration and alignment with multiple partners.,"For Google's Year in Search yearly trends round up (viewed up to 250m times) we have to deliver localised content into over 55 markets while still hitting a global 'day and date' launch.

Data & Analytics,,How do you use data to optimize content performance?,"Jellyfish uses data from a range of sources to optimize campaign performance. As your partner our objective would be to establish an operating system for advertising execution where data delivers competitive advantage and supports efficiency. Performance optimization per se is really one part of the bigger picture, and we would anticipate having good working relationships with your selected media agencies to enable the flow of data into a central planning capability. Jellyfish can support you in designing this function or we can share responsibilities with media. We recommend defining a strategy along the following lines.

1. Using data to develop creative 
As part of the briefing, our insight team can support smarter objective setting by audiences using a variety of planning tools. Depending on budget appetite for data and the scope of work, we can use detailed audience profiling (Experian et al) to Establish segments. We’d like to understand overlaps with the data you have and the data you could have on your audience. We’d expect to work with your media agency to define these segments and understand their behaviours at key points in the funnel, based on actions. As a start point, who shops, visited a lifestyle or recipe site, these targeting possibilities in certain social media can be highly specific and related to brand characteristics and behaviour. In social channels we can develop audiences against characteristics and previous behaviours, using custom and lookalike audience

2. Using data to make campaigns more effective
This area is where we need to connect effectively with the client’s own data strategy media partner and consequent ad  serving technology stack. As your partner, we can offer guidance on an approach to dynamic campaigns and programmatic (where campaigns can be automated). Examples of this include dynamic maps to add geo location for promotions; audience matching in Facebook; adding dynamic content to digital display and social content; creating dynamic rotation in digital out of home; creating dynamic content based on segmentation and location triggers; location based messaging. Outcomes of these campaign actions can driving footfall to a sampling location; improve engagement rates; in every instance connecting data and creative to bring commercial benefit.
Data we would use to deliver a high level of optimisation, in simplest terms, - would be
- who we are targeting: audience segmentations (personae)
- where they are: platform eg iOS, Android, [CLIENT], Social platform, other digital network;
- when they should be served content: date, time, weather, geo triggers, other platform behaviours/ retargeting pattern
- what content they are served (see ad planning decision tree model above in previous answer).

Jellyfish will support the client as required in collecting data from public (or contracted) services and deliver in a client defined format. This would include data collection and update; data enrichment and enhancement; data validation and verification; monitoring; maintenance real time data monitoring services that include continuous monitoring of various sites on a regular basis

3. Using data for reporting and analytics
As your partner we would expect to be able to provide a level of reporting that supports business performance and is easy to use and understand. The modern trend to dashboarding key data so senior management can that see KPIs are being tracked and met requires good access to a range of data sources. We would expect to build a good working relationship with your media partners to ensure reporting builds the full picture so that we can reallocate time and investment to areas that need more support, depending on performance. We are advocates for reporting that helps clients see both what has happened and why. Depending on the scope of our engagement, we can structure a reporting dashboard that provides as deep a level of reporting as you need.

Data sources for reporting will depend on the scope and scale of the engagement – specifically delivering campaign performance would require access to the DMP, DSP, adserving platform and social analytics (can be native on the platform or integrated into the ad server reporting function.) Campaign analytics can of course be set up to be realtime – enabling us to make changes or optimise creatives in channel, during the campaign lifecycle.

Typical analytics frameworks report on all industry standard cross channel metrics (clicks, conversions, frequency, interaction, video, etc.) and content optimisation specific metrics. We can process data at intervals required by client’s digital campaign stakeholders eg 24 hr, weekly etc) and is available via fully a configurable user interface, or by scheduled email delivery, API or even log file data transfer. Ultimately, as your creative production partners, we will support you to create a future state digital campaign engine that has intelligence and optimisation built into the system.

Data & Analytics,,"In the ever evolving landscape of consumer privacy, how do you help clients navigate perspectives on consumer and brand protection?","We have created category specific privacy playbooks that are regularly updated and cover these guiding principles

Vision - What levers do we want to use in marketing, and in order to do so what do we only need to collect to make the right decisions and create experiences for consumers with a reasonable value exchange.
Process - How do we adopt the correct consent management processes, implement appropriate tracking and focus on non pii focused methods for analysis and planning.
Execution - How to use the right solutions in tech to aid the modelling to fill in the data gaps so that we can be confident in the decisions we take.

There has never been such a thing as perfect data and never will be, however, we would run regular workshops with you to ensure you are up to date with the possibilities that technology allows you to act in the appropriate way. We don’t provide legal counsel but are adept at highlighting how to capture what you need or where you can use trend data instead. We have a talented team of CRM and Analytics experts working side by side with media teams to give you an unrivaled view of how this is impacting our industry.

We have also developed a range of social media listening and media transparency tools to ensure your brand stays safe and current. This transparency helps us navigate where a brand should be playing and areas of media which can or should be avoided.
",
Data & Analytics,,"How will your agency contribute to CLIENTs central data management strategy in order to manage the information needs of the global and local markets in an effective manner? This should address the development of architecture, taxonomy, policies, practices, procedures, tools, and analytics tech stack in order to feed into CLIENT’s first-party data, ingest data, extract actionable insights and gain predictive intelligence to drive CLIENT’s strategies.","We believe the distributed sharing of knowledge is essential rather than being locked away in a specific department or region. Athletes see their performance logs just as you should be presented with data in a way to aid incremental gains. With this starting point we ensure that with our wide range of data engineers and analysts you access and also are presented all the data possible, transformed in a way that fits with your centralised strategy.

It’s important to highlight that we consider first party data to mean more than audiences. It is your product, location, pricing, promotions, media/creative data and our understanding of how to use these datasets can contribute to a differentiated and scalable central strategy. It is this transformation and blending of data from multiple sources that provides the fuel for any predictive intelligence to work. We will challenge you to focus on alternative variables within the classic marketing formula which unearths actionable insights not considered before performance media.

Finally, data quality is paramount to this success. This can be achieved through people, processes and technology. Our methodological thinking in advance forms the creation of the correct data and then we use our processes and quality checking technologies we have developed specifically to ensure policies are adhered to. Whilst tags or conversion points might be a means to an end for a media buy, we recognise that this can be a weak point for many brands and if the core isn’t strong, the muscles cannot perform.

Media & SEO,,"We expect full transparency in how media is purchased. Please detail your agency’s approach to transparency, including financial accountability, rebates, optimization and reporting, ad verification, data and tools. What are your policies and processes around AVBs?","The Jellyfish business has built itself a unique identity, outside of the norm; outside of the networks; outside of traditional media agency culture. A model that reflects Jellyfish success from our clients growth, not as a by-product of media trading. 

Any media rebate we negotiate is from our clients media budget and therefore theirs is the benefit. Our marketplace leads curate publishers and supply based on brand and campaign KPIs and values, not from a set of remnant inventory. Our role is to provide effective and efficient supply, the right media mix with diversity, at the right cost. Where additional value can be negotiated it is passed directly to the brand in monetary, inventory or training value depending on the vendor. 

Judgement of Jellyfish is predicated on fair, transparent, measured assessments, open technology and fully transparent pricing. For the majority of our partners, we have helped license direct technology, establishing future proofed ecosystems, data structures and partnerships with vendors. Our role is to understand the need, help select the right partners, ensure best in market rates, the correct setup, implementation and training, not to mark up contracts for our own commercial gain.

With optimisation and reporting, our stance is the same. Client owned, future proofed ecosystems with consistent taxonomy and training provided. Open access to platforms and optimisation logs are available to all our clients.",

Jellyfish is also provided additional new feature adoption and implementation support by our partners to ensure that we not only are the first adopters in our category, but also that we adopt seemlessly and maximize the benefits of first mover advantage. A recent example of this is our migration to Value Based Bidding for Walden University (bidding to revenue). We worked with Google's Value Based Bidding product specialist to build a process and roadmap for implementation and recently launched the feature on Walden to become one of the first (if not the first) major EDU advertiser transitioned on to Value Based Bidding with Auction Time Bidding on SA360.

Our Social platform partnerships extend across Facebook, LinkedIn, Snap, Pinterest, and TikTok, with all of these being at a global level. These partnerships give us access to alpha and beta opportunities, externally published case studies, and most importantly, day-to-day on-demand support so that we can address any and every situation as it arises to make sure our performance never takes a hit. These tightly knit partnerships benefit our clients by allowing them to do the new and innovative, particularly in areas that aren't already saturated which helps bring costs down. In addition to our Social platform partnerships, we also have a global partnership with our Social tech platform - Media Ocean. Through the use of Media Ocean, we're able to unlock features that don't exist natively in platforms, which yields better results and time savings. We also have a seat at the table when it comes to product features, helping them create new features that allow for innovation that results in performance improvements, as well as processes to streamline workflows.

We'll identify test and control DMAs or geographic regions, establish baseline figures for the appropriate test KPI, determine the appropriate flight length for the test, and end with analysis of the statistical validity of the findings. For some channels and tests, we'll repeat to ensure the findings will scale to the broader media spend. ",

How often/at what frequency do you recommend testing? ",When testing creative we apply our two-speed approach. For short-term effectiveness we adopt a 14-30-day cycle to determine if the asset is fit for purpose in platform and is meeting the required metrics of the placement. For long-term effectiveness we leverage third-party partners such as System 1 to track metrics such as distinctiveness and momory over-time.

As part of this holistic approach we will audit and evaluate existing creative assets to uncover opportunities for optimization, reformatting and testing. Suitable assets are then recommended for specific optimizations based on channel and format best practices and then introduced into a strategic testing framework designed to uncover brand-specific takeaways. This process is then repeated frequently, on short, iterative cycles to ensure that the A/B testing learnings are being applied in a meaningful manner, that all creative possibilities are being explored and that the full potential of each and every asset is maximized when it comes to performance, reach, and ROI. Following this approach allows our clients to get the most out of their creative budgets and overall investment in creative assets.  ",
Media & SEO,,"If relevant, what is your approach to testing TV and Radio creative? What frequency to you recommend testing? ","Our approach to TV and Radio testing is similar to our overall approach to creative testing. We apply our two-speed approach. For short-term effectiveness we adopt a 14-30-day cycle to determine if the asset is fit for purpose in platform and is meeting the required metrics of the placement. For long-term effectiveness we leverage third-party partners such as System 1 to track metrics such as distinctiveness and memory over-time. We collaborate with you and your creative development partners to ensure that all assets leverage the distinct strategy of each brand. For TV and Radio, we can also look to test these assets in more agile digital channels - e.g., CTV or programmatic audio, prior to going live in linear or terrestrial placements",
Media & SEO,,"How have you measured success of a client's paid media for upper funnel channels (to awareness, and consideration placements, for instance)? ","Some awareness or brand growth oriented media should be measured with brand tracking solutions, like YouGov or Kantar. Awareness media often comes with platform provided brand awareness measures, such as Brand Lift via Millward Brown on Facebook or YouTube's flexible and on-demand brand lift studies available directly in DV360. This should be supplemented with multi-touch attribution and tracking solutions, that map the relative value of awareness and upper funnel touchpoints eventually towards conversion. We also consider other data points like growth in search demand and share of voice over time, as well as looking at specific data cuts within our Hybrid Media Mix Modelling product aimed at measuring the impact of awareness messaging on overall business outcomes.

Media & SEO,SEO,How do you view the synergies between paid and organic? How do you work with clients and potentially 3rd parties to fully leverage synergies between these two areas?,"How do you view the synergies between SEM and SEO?

Modern brands are tasked with responding to the complexities of an increasingly dynamic search landscape, and such diversity cannot be tackled through siloed channels alone. Only by unifying their approach to search can brands truly maximize dominance.

This requires a shift in mindset...from ""either/or"" to ""best of both"". (e.g. not ""stopping SEM when SEO is above the fold, thus reducing spend"" but instead ""Synchronizing SEM+SEO to continually serve consumer requests with highly relevant experiences"".

There are a number of reasons for this:
▪ SEM is no longer keyword-based, but audience based
▪ Google’s result pages have greater UX w/enriched formats
▪ SEM has always had better conversion rate
▪ SEO supports SEM where it can

As such, an integrated approach to holistic search is imperative to maximizing performance potential and benefit. Simply put, a fully-integrated search strategy affords brands the opportunity to own a greater share of the consumer search experience, and to be more relevant across their journey.

In response to this constant evolution of the search landscape, and the necessity of channel alignment, Jellyfish has developed and adopted a methodology devised to ensure our search practices work in unison, to deliver the most value and performance towards the brands we engage with. This methodology is distilled down to three primary components: Answer, Engage, Convert.

1. Answer: Ensure 100% coverage across the entirety of the consumer search journey, from awareness to conversion.

2. Engage: Display the most relevant content at the most relevant time, in accordance with the user's intention.

3. Convert: Ensure 100% conversion potential with performance landing pages designed to deliver experiences matching the intent of any given search

How do you work with clients and potentially 3rd parties to fully leverage synergies between these two areas?
▪ Servicing paid and organic as one Jellyfish makes collaborating and devising coverage strategies much more efficient and effective
▪ While we have worked with 3rd party parties on single channel SEO accounts, the integration poses some challenges that require project & client management to integrate in a similar fashion.",
Media & SEO,SEO,Do you work closely with any specific SEO partners/3rd parties that you recommend to fully maximize both paid and organic? ,"All client work is fully-facilitated exclusively by Jellyfish employees, however, we have established key partnerships with enterprise platform providers, such as BrightEdge, SearchMetrics and DeepCrawl, which allows us to ensure access to new features and betas, as part of our technology offering.",

Prop Technology,,Do you have any owned or preferred distribution networks? What metrics do you use to understand how digital content has delivered on goals?,"Within our VIVID system is a high speed dedicated delivery network technology called Jellyfish Pipeline. 

Delivery to media owners is currently via:
Broadcast/moving image - Ad-Stream / IMD / Honeycomb
Print - Qmuli/Ad-Fast
Digital - Wave2 via DoubleClick
All of which provide a full audit trail and proof of receipt/delivery. We would love to add tracking codes to all of our digital work produced (for later analytics on campaign effectiveness). However, due to the current complexities of digital delivery adding ‘tracking codes’ would be possible but only with client permission for access to the media company’s reports rather than attempting to add Jellyfish tracking codes.

Otherwise the tracking codes will be rejected by the:
- Ad network
- Media company / creative agency
- Publications
For reasons of:
- Legal and data privacy
- Technical complexity
- Their commercial considerations - business model

Normally the tracking code is owned by the ad network, and they will disseminate the data to the media company and the publications. Clients normally get the performance data via their media buyer or creative agency.",
Prop Technology,,"What workflow systems or digital asset management platforms does your company have experience of using? Is there one that is mandatory for your clients? If many, please detail your top 3-5 preferred. If your company has proprietary technology, please detail as well.","Given the breadth of services Jellyfish offers, we work with a multitude of standard industry platforms based around consumer preferences, our clients’ technology platforms and their media agencies’ technology platforms. That list is too extensive to detail here and can be provided sepertaly if needed.

As early adopters in the MarTech industry, we have developed our own marketing technology platform, VIVID, through integrating best-in-breed third party software. VIVID is an easy-to-use, quick-to-implement and highly configurable online solution. It allows Jellyfish and our clients to centrally manage all campaigns, share assets, automate asset creation, collaborate in real time, approve assets online, distribute final assets to all media, archive all content and report on all activity. This eliminates confusing email threads with lots of participants, dispersed assets, massive email attachments and bottlenecks in workflows. Using VIVID leads to large reductions in time to market, workflow efficiencies, increased brand consistency and cost savings. This has been proven time and again by our clients with VIVID currently being used by 26 clients, across 10 industry sectors, in 45 countries. It is not mandatory for clients to use, however using VIVID will keep the approval process streamlined and make the process more efficient and cost effective. The system is tailored to indivdual client needs and workflows fit around client's specific requirements and preferences. VIVID implementation can be scaled accordingly, from simple approvals modules through to a fully integrated and tailored system.

The core technologies that are integrated within the VIVID marketing management platform are detailed below:

Encode: Highly flexible workflow and asset management platform
Cantemo: Market-leading Media Asset Management platform used to manage moving content workflows and encoding
Slack: Instant messaging and collaboration tool
Wave2: Powerful automation engine used to automate print and digital display (HTML5) campaigns from templates
Mosaico: Open source email template builder
Time Manager: Internally developed time recording and resource planning tool
Beebox from Wordbee: Translation management platform
ProofHQ: World leading online proofing platform

To highlight the pace of change in the VIVID platform, two of these software products have been integrated in the last month (Wordbee & Wave 2 expansion). Jellyfish is also currently looking at integrating HubSpot into VIVID to extend its capability into SEO, social media and analytics. Separately, Jellyfish also works with Salesforce. The VIVID platform is in turn integrated with Jellyfish’s financial management system, NetSuite. 

As referenced above, both because of what we do and the review of the MarTech landscape we carried out the end of last year/beginning of this year, Jellyfish is familiar with a much wider range of marketing technologies. We are therefore able to provide an informed view as to what technologies clients should include in their technology ecosystems as well as continue to evolve the VIVID platform. The list of technologies Jellyfish has reviewed over the last nine months is too exhaustive to list here in full, but the primary list includes:
Mobile Marketing: Mojiva, Vibes
Email Marketing: Movable Ink
Display & Native ads: DoubleClick, Sizmek, Adobe Media Optimizer
Video Marketing & Ads: Celltra, WeVideo, Innovid, WireWax
Social Media Marketing: HootSuite, Sprinklr, Percolate
Content Marketing: Kapost, Curate
Platforms: Adobe Marketing Cloud, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Oracle Marketing Cloud
Jellyfish increasingly works closely with clients’ marketing and technology departments to shape their technology ecosystems based on existing investments, current and future needs and their current ways of working and organisation structures.

For example, for Value Retail - a company specialising exclusively in the creation and operation of luxury outlet shopping destinations in Europe and China - we have implemented a version of our VIVID platform to manage assets, usage rights and automation through templates and are now integrating this with their existing Salesforce implementation. We are also helping their IT team with the creation of training videos as they endeavour to roll-out common technology and ways of working across all their retail villages.",
Prop Technology,,"How does your company manage clients’ production budgets? Are any financial tools used, proprietary or licensed?","Jellyfish has fully integrated the 'front office' project management system (VIVID) with our 'back office' finance management system, NetSuite (recently acquired by Oracle). 

NetSuite is a full ERP cloud based finance solution that allows Jellyfish synchronised reporting and automation. Instead of forcing Jellyfish employees to maintain separate databases and spreadsheets that have to be manually managed and merged to generate reports, VIVID/NetSuite allows staff to pull reports from the one system. VIVID/NetSuite share multiple databases, estimates, purchase orders, wip reports, etc.) that support multiple functions used by different client teams. In practice, this means that Jellyfish Project Managers in different client teams can rely on central, one version information.

VIVID Overview
 - VIVID allows us a top level view of the day to day details at a glance
 - User-friendly, graphic dashboards so we can slice and dice data as required
 - Linked to VIVID is our core finance system NetSuite; this allows us to peel back the layers and look at overall profitability across an entire network of offices, campaigns, projects and jobs.

 - Utilisation and billable work: real time finance data, right down to the project or individual level
 - Fees: allows us to monitor actual hours versus fee hours for reconciliation and review

Campaign analytics can of course be set up to be realtime – enabling us to make changes or optimise creatives in channel, during the campaign lifecycle. We would expect to build a good working relationship with your media partners to provide reporting that builds the full picture so that we can reallocate time and investment to areas that need more support, depending on performance. Typical analytics frameworks report on all industry standard cross-channel metrics (clicks, conversions, frequency, interaction, video, etc.) and content optimisation specific metrics.

Once we have completed the internal casting process, we will provide [CLIENT] with a minimum of 2-3 casting options to chose from, based on the key requirements of the brief.
2. Talent Involvement: Selected talent is involved and briefed on the overall campaign. Any specific brand pronunciation and intonation preferences or guidelines are highlighted. They are then given time to review final scripts and flag concerns or questions that can be addressed before the recording. This has proven to save time and costs by resolving queries ahead of recording sessions.
3. Language Direction: When we book the recording with the chosen VO talent and studio session, we ensure the in-market language director will be in attendance. This guarantees that we achieve the linguistic accuracy, intonation and fluidity required.

They will oversee the day to day running of the account, involving the relevant teams and expertise across the Jellyfish network (all-channel production, creative services, content, language services teams, technology etc.) dependent on the nature of work and volumes. This person will work closely with your Account Director, who will monitor the account from a strategic perspective and be present at all review sessions to ensure your feedback is incorporated into continuous improvements and that agreed KPIs and SLAs are adhered to. Your Jellyfish Account Director will report directly the Group Client Services Director and our Senior Management team. ",Oct 2021
Implementation & Onboarding,Content,How can you support us in setting up the internal content studio?,"Within the framework of the agreed outline production strategy and scope of work/engagement, and working with your relevant internal teams, we can help set up efficient and effective content studios in a variety of areas.

Organisation: Identify the appropriate structure for the studios – roles, responsibilities, skill-sets – and the appropriate governance framework.

People: Assist in the recruitment process for the agreed roles/skillsets.

Process: Identify and implement appropriate ways of working, workflow and approval processes to dovetail with with the agreed technologies.

Technology: Identify and implement appropriate technologies from production technologies (hardware, software, servers) to marketing operations, content organisation and optimisation software so as to maximise efficiency and effectiveness. 

We are confident that we have the requisite skills and resources to help you set up best-in-breed content studios within the right global and local content framework. From our perspective it is about identifying the level of engagement you are looking for – from light touch consultative advice to full implementation, or somewhere in between.",Oct 2021
Implementation & Onboarding,,"Provide 3 key learnings from previous implementation challenges that your company has learned/Please explain what you need from [CLIENT] to make this a successful relationship (skills, service, data, culture etc","We understand that transitioning to a new way of working can be extremely challenging. We have a hugely experienced team and proven, robust implementation and on-boarding plan to ensure we lay the foundations upon which a solid and effective solution is built. It is vital that we work collaboratively from the outset of our engagement to fully understand your scope of work and requirements. Three core learnings to facilitate a smooth implementation are as follows: 
1. Full immersion into the world of [CLIENT]. We need to understand your processes, ways of working and requirements. This will help us to tailor our recommendations and provide an efficient and effective solution.
2. Open communication channels. Appointing an 'Implementation Champion' from the client team is vital to driving engagement with the project internally. We can also provide you with advice and assistance around the development of a communications strategy to ensure the transition to Jellyfish is communicated to the wider company in an appropriate and timely manner.
3. Training. We will work with [CLIENT] to identify core members of your team who will require training. We believe that training requirements are three-fold: 
- Immersion: This includes meeting the dedicated Jellyfish team, understanding the Jellyfish function, understanding agreed KPIs and SLAs, how the process will be defined and measured. 
- Technology: Introduction to any technology that Jellyfish is operating as part of our solution to [CLIENT] and ensuring the team is aligned on its function and capabilities. 
- Continuous improvement: Monthly feedback sessions are designed to drive efficiencies across the account. These factors can include streamlining, rationalization of process, evaluation, feedback and the identification of requirements for additional or wider training.

Implementation & Onboarding,,"Please describe how your Agency handles transition when acquiring a new account, and/or managing client mergers and acquisitions involving new business (e.g., best practices, processes, duration of the transition, deliverables). 

. ","""We follow our Discovery > Design > Build > Run framework for account transitions. The Discovery phase is a deep dive in to your business, understanding of your objective and KPIs, your values and brand immersion. It also include technical, structural, automation and account audits that help us to understand your current state and informs our next phase, Design. This is where we take everything we learned from the Discovery phase and put into plans and account/infrastructure architectures that will align with your key business objectives, particularly with regards to the cross-brand management and strategy for both Chamberlain University and Walden University. This will include anything from ad tech platforms standup such as GMP, potential restructures of your Search account if necessary, and a full roadmap and timeline for everything we want to accomplish on the business. Our timeline for Discover and Design phase is around 4-6 weeks.

Then we move on to the Build phase. When it comes to transferring one existing account to our MCC in Search or our Ad Manager in Social, we have an extensive process and list of tasks that we follow but we primarily require admin access and then the ability to complete the migration or at minimum receive access to work. As part of the Build phase, we may start to execute some of the higher priority tasks that we identified in the Design phase, this may include critical campaign structural adjustments, keyword expansions, asset / placement pauses, negative additions, URL and Ad Copy edits and more. We would implement updated tech and measurement structures during this phase, across the Google Marketing Platform and across Social platforms where applicable too. We'd build a robust strategy around managing overlap campaigns for Nursing and Social Work degrees between Chamberlain and Walden and begin to implement some of the more technical needs of this dual management approach, including a business data feed and setting updated ROAS targets per program.""",
Account Management,,What are the key cost saving drivers?,"We see our clients benefit from a spectrum of cost savings from 25% up to 58% dependent on the extent of the uptake of technology. Simple decoupling and the implementation of an online system delivers a 25% to 30% saving but to achieve 50%+ savings requires high adoption of full automation of assets. Across this spectrum, the key cost saving drivers come from:

1 Process Efficiency: The right process delivers a more efficient way of working that reduces both agency and client time and consequently delivers cost savings.
2 Agile Working: An extension of process efficiency is to have an agile way of working where assets are delivered faster and consequently for a lower cost.
3 Impact of Scale Consolidation of production at scale drives savings: The impact of this tends to have more benefit for global and regional brands in multiple markets, over local ones who by definition are in single markets.
4 Wastage Avoidance: By having increased transparency and visibility of asset management you can avoid the cost of having unused or duplicated assets.

Account Management,,Provide an example of when your system or process broke. Why did it break? And what did you learn from it?,"The implementation phase during a new partnership can become problematic when there is a lack of engagement with the internal client, so maintaining open lines of communication and regular catch up sessions is key to ensuring we adhere to timelines and deadlines. We are highly experienced in on-boarding global clients – indeed we have implemented Jellyfish solutions for clients including Google, Nike, Innocent, PVH, Under Armour, DowDuPont and Sonos. From the outset of our engagement, Jellyfish will work collaboratively with your team to fully understand your scope of work and requirements, providing the foundation upon which to build our partnership.

A key element of this scoping exercise is to identify peaks and troughs in activity, ensuring careful resource planning and workload scheduling. The more notice we can have from you about a big campaign or project, the easier it will be for us to ramp up resource as required. SLAs and KPIs regarding such situations will be defined during the discovery and implementation phases to ensure teams from [CLIENT], Splash and other relevant stakeholders are aligned, and expectations managed. 

In the event of acquisitions, Splash would welcome the opportunity to liaise with the [CLIENT] team to assess the scope of work required and will flex and scale the team to meet your requirements.

It is our team's remit to best configure the technology and automated bidding tactics to extract maximum value from our platforms. Our media optimization approach maximizes algorithmic effectiveness and machine learning, while also pursuing extensive analysis, creativity, and operational excellence to execute sophistication at scale. Our programmatic experts constantly leverage data and insight to improve campaign effectiveness as well as provide thorough advanced insights which drive the maturity of your marketing efforts. At Jellyfish, we utilize automation whenever possible (reporting, campaign launch, campaign updates, etc.), but there is still a human touch to all of these activities and when ad hoc requests arise. Even when utilizing automation, there are still QA checks completed on all tasks to make sure the outcome of a task is accurate (regardless if it was done manually or via automation).",Nov 2021
Account Management,,How frequently will campaign managers be in each campaign?,"Daily. We follow a rigorous optimization cadence which is tailored to the specific campaign outcomes necessary to Prudential's marketing objectives.

Implementation & Onboarding,,"Describe your preferred onboarding process, based on the most successful engagements of this magnitude.","The onboarding process with Jellyfish centers around our Discovery, Design, Build, and Run framework, with a focus on Discovery and Design. 

Discovery - the initial step in the onboarding process begins with a deep dive of a client's business by understanding their goals, challenges (both internal and external), and historic successes that should be repeated and scaled out. Key components of understanding a business include:
  - data access and ownership - does the client have access to their 1st party data and how can that be leveraged across media executions?
  - tagging - what is currently tagged on all owned and operated properties? 
  - measurement - how is success being defined? what limitations are currently being encountered that need to be addressed for growth?

Design - after the Discovery phase, we can then look to design a media plan that centers around the goals, builds from previous successes, and strategicially navigates from the challenges so that the execution is designed to succeed. Some elements of Design include:
  - identifying 1st party data segments available that can be deployed across various platforms
  - selecting platforms that make the most sense to find our key customers and developing our full-year activation strategy that accounts for seasonlity and fluctuations in the market
  - setting up a measurement framework that accounts for the walled gardens and still have a source of truth that can keep us honest and move in the right direction, positively impacting business outcomes",Nov 2021

The [CLIENT] account will be closely monitored by our Senior Management Team from the outset, to ensure that the service that we are delivering provides the best possible solution to you. As mentioned above, communication is key to the successful running of an account, and we will work to ensure that feedback, action points and any escalation points are addressed in a timely and effective manner

From the outset of our engagement with [CLIENT] Splash will work to lay the foundations upon which a solid and effective solution can be built. It is vital that we work collaboratively to fully understand your scope of work and requirements.

Clientele,,What is your current number of clients?," Jellyfish currently has 1000+ clients, which includes self-service clients through our technology reselling business for Google and other tech partners.",Oct 2021
Industry Experience,,What was one of your agency’s biggest mistakes? How did you resolve it?,"About 6 years ago, we spent $100,000 on media for Walden University (part of Laureate Education) that went for naught, as our fulfillment system failed over a weekend, and no leads were captured. We made a change on a Friday at our client’s request and we didn’t have the systems in place as a failsafe. 

Resolution:
We have a stringent process for approvals, whether it be for sites we build/host, ad copy created, etc. As for the Walden issue, we don’t make any changes to a website on a Friday, unless mission-critical, so that we can limit the unforeseen issues. 
We developed SafetyNet, a platform that alerts when there are performance anomalies, such as leads/sales/subscriptions down dramatically versus the average. And, if a website is down, SafetyNet pauses the paid media activity. 
We have automated reports distributed to the Jellyfish Walden team daily, at multiple times during the day (but at the same time each day) so that we can spot anomalies. ",Oct 2021
Industry Experience,,What is an example of how you leverage your close relationships with the media community to ensure priority access to first mover and/or category exclusive media opportunities.,"We have built close relationships with the media community - media owners and platforms - and base those relationships on a foundation of great work.  Partners trust  Jellyfish’s exceptional execution and implementation skills in digital media, as well as our responsiveness and core value of “being the solution.”   

We are preferred partners for many media owners, including Google (Premier Partner) and Facebook (Premium Partner).  As a Google Premier Partner, Jellyfish frequently tests first-to-market Alpha and Beta products. Our first-mover opportunities with Google have included Custom Algorithms in DBM, Brand Lift 2.0 measurement solutions for YouTube, In-Banner Live Streaming Ads, and Conversion Lift Tests in AdWords, among others.  

We have co-developed a number tools and extensions that enhance the capabilities of our media and technology partners, and ultimately provide unique advantages to our clients.   In addition, we serve as consultants to our preferred partners to advise on emerging trends, market adoption, and feature development, influencing the prioritization of key initiatives.

 Jellyfish has partnered with Facebook as a participant in the beta test for Instagram Discovery ads.  Additionally, through our close relationships with Google and other major programmatic partners.  Jellyfish gets a first look at major industry updates such as Google’s FLoC and TheTradeDesk’s UID2 solutions.",Oct 2021
Martech & Adtech,,What are the steps/ processes taken for data validation and quality assurance ? Please highlight any automated processes,"Jellyfish utilizes Google Cloud Platform for data quality and validation. This will primarily be facilitating feeds into BigQuery via Data Flow or native integrations (e.g. GA360), applying validation logic, and setting a virtual machine to run this daily. This must be automated from data collection to validation and alerting. We find quality assurance issues occur most often wherever manual interventions are used, so Jellyfish keeps those processes completely automated.  We have dedicated QA testers to ensure our workflow meets both the functional and non-functional requirements. From the data analytics side, we employ rigorous testing steps leveraging various testing methodologies that inspect data issues related to missing data, invalid data sets, illegal data formats, data partition issues, data mismatching, duplication, etc.

We have developed extensive workflows to support QA of all platform implementation, tagging requirements, and media activations.   Automated audit tools and technologies, building on top of the platform APIs, are used to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of the audit processes.  We’ve developed platform extensions leveraging appscript and python to automate and drive scale in the workflows required to traffic and launch media campaigns.   In addition,  user management and access control for media and technology platforms are handled through a specialized technical team to ensure governance and authorization.
",Oct 2021
Martech & Adtech,,Can automated alerts be set-up for any problems?,"Automated alerts can be implemented directly within many of our activation and analytics platforms, as well as through the use of our proprietary tools.  Examples of metrics that can benefit from alert automation are pacing, performance KPIs, approvals/rejections, and site activities.

Alerts can also be configured based on validation criteria defined within BigQuery. These alerts will be via email as standard but can be extended to other means (e.g. SMS). Block Lists and Negative Keyword lists can be adjusted in platforms based on email alerts for breaking news events.

As also mentioned in Question 4b, Jellyfish developed SafetyNet. SafetyNet is an automated early warning system that continually checks your paid search activity for any performance anomalies and critical errors that could result in downtime or wasted spend.

Martech & Adtech,,Does your agency actively Black-List sites and networks?,"
Jellyfish prides itself on a multi-layered approach when it comes to vetting all supply sources and inventory partnerships.  Blocklisting both sites and ad networks is a vital part of this process, and because of this, we are constantly updating these lists to fit client needs. Jellyfish maintains standardized blocklists, which are applied in addition to custom blocklists created in coordination with client brand suitability guidelines. Adjustments to a client blocklist are made for several reasons, including performance, fraudulent activity, or content not meeting client expectations and/or values. We also leverage 3rd party vendor verification tools to help provide insight and guidance into how we make decisions around blocklisting.",Oct 2021
Martech & Adtech,,How do you account for Bot Traffic and ad Fraud? Which Ad Fraud tool do you partner with?,"As part of our Jellyfish Supply Optimization approach, Invalid Traffic (IVT) and Brand Safety audits are regularly carried out to ensure all inventory being purchased by Jellyfish is legitimate and of appropriate quality. Using activation platform settings in combination with MRC accredited vendors, we can closely monitor and identify any publishers pushing inventory with high levels of bot traffic and ad fraud and add these sites to our blocklists. Daily checks, as well as monthly brand-specific deep dives, allow us to ensure that we maintain extremely insignificant levels of IVT. 

IAB’s ads.txt protocol is also used as standard practice to further ensure the prevention of bot traffic and ad fraud, increasing transparency for our clients, and providing confidence in the authenticity of the inventory we purchase.

Jellyfish has expertise across major ad fraud and viewability vendors depending on existing client relationships, with our preferred partner recommendation of Integral Ad Science (IAS).",Oct 2021
Martech & Adtech,,Please indicate any other data validation or quality assurance capabilities?,"We approach data validation and quality assurance in three areas:

Data validation: We have extensive processes developed from data collection to data validation and data processing. We developed automated audit tools and technologies, building on top of the platform APIs, to ensure the data quality as well the efficiency and effectiveness of the audit processes. We pay attention to the quality of the data, as well as the user management and access control, to ensure the data is handled in compliance with the rules and regulations.

Data processing and testing: We follow best practices of data transformation to ensure data integrity and engineering efficiency. We have dedicated QA testers to ensure our workflow meets both the functional and non-functional requirements. From the data analytics side, we employ rigorous testing steps leveraging various testing methodologies that inspect data issues related to missing data, invalid data sets, illegal data formats, data partition issues, data mismatching, duplication, freshness/recency, data unification, data value distribution, etc.

Media Reporting,,"How do you show us where ads are running, how much the real-time bidding is costing, and the optimizations that are being made?","All inventory sources and placements can be included within our reporting, along with trackers that show ad status (live, paused, scheduled). Cost per Impressions can be incorporated into reporting for all RTB media.

Optimizations are shared in several ways. Smaller spend optimizations can be tracked in shared, client-facing change logs illustrating our “business as usual” tweaks and adjustments in the service of standard campaign performance. Ongoing performance optimizations can be and are often shared as part of regular reporting updates. Larger recommendations and changes are done in consultations with client teams - rebalancing spend between channels or creative/messaging optimization.

Transparency and accessibility are thematic to the way we partner with our clients, spanning from strategic direction through to granular reporting of all platform and media metrics. Media economics and costs, as well as data on the Network/Site/Page level, are each fully disclosed and can be presented in reporting formats as necessary, or pushed to a cloud storage solution. 

Beyond access, the expertise of our media and data teams will uncover trends, insights, and optimization opportunities from the wealth of granular data. These findings and tactical recommendations are the focus of our communication and reporting cadence, while the raw data is made available for analysis or validation.
",Oct 2021
Pricing,,Have you worked with clients in an incentive-based payment model? What elements of service were incentivized? What sort of reporting was required to power that model? What were the benefits and weaknesses of that approach?,"Yes, we have worked in an incentivize-based payment model. We found it better to incentivize the entire activity, from a tracking and performance perspective, than to break down certain elements.

Whatever the KPIs to be paid off of, we would require the data underlying that. 

Benefits
- Aligns our interests, whatever is your most important metric(s), we will be measured on the same and paid incentives for achieving / exceeding.

Weaknesses
- It is never simple. 
- Marketing is rarely 1 or 2 key metrics, it is typically a combination. Both trials AND paying customers are important metrics for HBO Max. If we are incentivized on just 1, it is possible to not deliver on the 2nd. 
- CPAs are typical targets, though the cleanliness and effectiveness of CPAs can often depend on the overall media mix, the mix of trials, and new customers. ",Oct 2021
Industry Experience,,What is your agency’s POV on the movement towards consumer privacy and “cookie-less” future?,"Our POV at Jellyfish is two-fold.  First, we recognize and support the shift in consumer privacy trending towards greater individual control over personal data.  Second, despite Google delaying its plans to phase out third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, we advocate that brands actively plan and test to be ready for this world and to be able to innovate and thrive relative to competitors. 

Regulatory and technical changes are directed this way as privacy laws are introduced globally and browsers/operating systems deprecate support for tracking and individual user identification. This means that media and technical strategies need to address several challenges:

Data Collection Challenges 
With more fragmented ecosystems, it will be harder to get a complete overview of consumer’s lifecycle
Current global data collection frameworks will not meet local legal compliance requirements

Measurement Challenges
Conversion tracking will be limited and will not represent your business’ reality
Attribution models will under evaluate media performances, especially on display & video campaigns
User-level incrementality protocols will no longer be reliable to identify performance levers

Activation Challenges
Targeting using both First and Third party audiences will see significant drops in addressable audience 
Personalization that relies on cookie-derived audiences will fail
Product level remarketing (or 1:1) personalization will be limited 

To address these challenges, we recommend a “privacy by design” approach. 
This is an opportunity for brands to rethink their approach to digital marketing and implement innovative and privacy-preserving strategies to leverage their first-party data while fostering consumer trust.  Privacy is an inherent component of any strategy to facilitate transparent, data-driven marketing.

As your  digital partner, we’ll provide strategic and technical insights to enable you to best reconcile digital marketing performance and privacy compliance.  We are expert and agnostic, and are able to support you with all digital marketing processes involving data, from consent management and data collection to attribution, insights and activation.  

Using this approach, we’ll help you to determine and collect the metrics that matter, leverage technology to build a unified, privacy compliant measurement framework, bridge the gap with durable first party measurement, and embrace consent management.

Although we place great importance on data, and particularly 1st party data, at Jellyfish the most important factor in making data usable and valuable, is our people. They are involved at every stage from brief and planning, through optimization, measurement and analysis. They are our biggest asset and we augment their own potential with data and technology. As part of  XXXXXJellyfish team, you will have direct access to specialists in analytics, data science, market intelligence, CRM, Mar-tech and Ad-tech, BI analyst, UX consultants and creative technologists. We will operate a fixed team in the lead roles but in order to realize the full depth and breadth of our team (200+ data and analytics, 150 engineers globally), we will work in an agile manner to bring in team members as pursuant to the challenge.

Our first port of call with a new client is ensuring data collection is carried out in a consistent manner on the most suitable platform, based on a unified measurement framework founded on an aligned hierarchy of business and marketing objectives which is future proofed for a cookieless environment. This measurement framework - not just identifying the metrics that matter, but identifying the platforms, methodologies and data we need to measure and activate/optimize both immediately and in the long term, within one channel and across all marketing, both at the level of one user’s full journey and across cohorts more broadly. We recognize that there isn’t a single best source of truth and use the variety of inputs and outputs along with understanding of duplications, gaps, weightings, and boundaries to guide the business directionally. 

The design of this measurement framework is done in conjunction with building or examining an ecosystem for the technology to collect, store and analyze data for XXXXX. Our ethos is to think privacy first and that has nevermore been important. With media performance we will measure media in a cross channel way to identify areas of inefficient spend, tactics to test with increased budget and ways to optimize spend with a re-distributed budget. We would use a DDA model within GA4 as a best practice in order to maximize data coverage and adherence to data privacy regulations and to best optimize media directly towards that model in real time. Our campaign plans align with your internal reporting and segmentation structures and those of other marketing activities in order to create a unified data model that allows us to easily report and analyze the media data and attribute performance.

We also utilize platform conversion lift studies as well as proprietary geo -experiments to understand incrementality and get a holistic view of performance across walled gardens and make budgetary recommendations based on that. 

Our real-time automated dashboards, built upon a unified data foundation of agreed KPIs and tracked against targets and shared for dissemination of information to various stakeholder types ensure regular alignment around optimizations and tactic changes rather than reporting numbers. Regular analysis is provided as part of a recurring measurement pack shared with you looking at elements such as optimal frequency, cross over of tactics, role of channels and analysis into  creative or formats. Insights are structured to drive understanding of “why or why not?” and then “so what?” to identify what worked, what didn’t, and support actionability.

In addition QBRs will outline a clear roadmap of improvements and testing to ensure we continuously evolve and increase your digital maturity.

Alongside analysis and reporting from digital platforms such as Google Analytics and the GMP,  Facebook, App tweak and a multitude of others, we will also overlay 3rd party research and our own proprietary tools to add context and recommendations to what we are seeing these include social listening tools like brand watch, competitor monitoring such as similar web and omnibus surveys such as You Gov and GWI as well as spend from Nielsen.

We then use these learning to make future plans and ensure we are always iterating and incorporating learnings moving forward.

Creative,,Please describe your approch to developing insights and strtegy that lead to break-through ideas and strategic platforms for brands.,"Jellyfish was born out of digital and for the platform world. We have focused on capabilities that can create, activate, enable and analyze campaigns that deliver the right experience to the right audience, for the right cost, and wherever possible measured to the nth degree. Center to all of our work, is the consumer, and ensuring we deliver a consistent experience in a positive manner whether we are looking to inspire or create action. It’s what unites our teams, translated into their own area of expertise, and their role in achieving consumer centric communications. Through our combination of strategy, planning and customer experience we teams use a very defined process to arrive at key decisions, fuelled by a combination of industry and proprietary tools.

We acknowledge that from the moment we begin working with you, we can no longer consider our perspectives to be reflective of an independent agent - able to assume anything about how consumers think and feel about your brand. To counter this we have created a Market Intelligence capability at Jellyfish responsible for providing our internal teams with a market-oriented perspective of consumers and competitors to fuel insights and strategy. This team is an element of our Platform Planning Process, but remains separate from our Media and Brand Strategy capabilities to ensure that media perspectives and institutional brand knowledge do not cloud our judgment in planning effectively for your true consumers. The market intelligence capability uses a combination of tools and methodologies to understand where universal truths exist and may also be limited to individual/ local insight. From one-on-one interviews, surveys, syndicated data tools and evidence from media partnerships, the Market Intelligence team finds custom solutions to our strategic questions to elevate every strategy we create and and identify break-through ideas. 

With our own creative team in-house we are experienced at developing strategic platforms which are meaningful in the world of your consumers. Our approach to developing insights and strategy is to be collaborative, we work with various brands and their partner creative agencies to ensure that media guides creative and messaging guides moments. Ensuring that all teams are aligned on objectives for every campaign, we rally around guiding principles where media plans are balanced and focused on meeting business and brand objectives. 

Where building mental availability, not just awareness, is the basic role for advertising.
Where everything is seen as contributing to brand-building and performance.
Where advertising’s ‘emotional’ role is primary but not separate from any ‘rational’ role.
Where nudging brand memories is used as a way to trigger short-term impact.",June 2022 Yahoo RFI
Implementation & Onboarding,,Please demonstrate the strategies and tools your agency uses to optimize toward long term retention using in-app event postbacks.,"The first priority to enable optimisations towards longer-term and deeper funnel metrics, is to consolidate and merge data sets in a way which provides us with a granular, yet also holistic, view of marketing performance. At Jellyfish, we believe it is critical for mobile optimisation to be able to consolidate data from across the client’s MMP, their in-app analytics partner (eg Firebase, Amplitude), partner side platforms (Facebook, Google, Apple), and any mCRM platforms (eg Braze). A visualization tool like Google Data Studios or Tableau, a data pipeline tool like Funnel.io, and cloud platform instance with a dedicated workspace for Jellyfish to perform analysis - are all vital elements for such reporting.


Assuming this is in place, we will be able to connect marketing spend at the channel and campaign level, to the LTV or ROI represented at the in-app event level, and hence able to take the right decisions on media investment and budget allocation. For example, utilizing Apple Search Ads on its own will only allow us to track campaigns to the cost per install. Consolidating this with MMP data will allow us to understand CPAs, LTV and ROI at the keyword level, so we can make micro-bid adjustments at high levels of precision. Next, using Hybrid mix media modeling will allow us to understand the position that search campaigns play within our overall marketing plan, and will add insights into attribution journeys and the relative value of different channels, allowing us to understand for instance, that programmatic video spend on brand campaigns drive up awareness which is then harnessed by DR campaigns further down the funnel.

The insight from reporting thus allows us to make the best decisions on current campaign optimisations at the in-app event level (e.g. cost per registration, cost per first trial, cost per first purchase). However it is the case that in-app event postbacks on iOS are becoming increasingly challenging to gain in sufficient volumes due to the privacy changes with iOS14. Consolidated reporting of historical performance data thus becomes even more important in providing us with a baseline from which we can model future campaigns.

Specifically regarding retention metrics, we have a variety of strategies:
For metrics such as day 7, day 14, day 30 usage volumes, we can analyse campaigns by cohorted view, to understand which tactics are contributing to more highly retained users, and optimise accordingly.

For retention understood as re-engaged users, we can create specific audience segments within either the MMP or platforms such as Google or social, and then run campaigns targeting these specific segments, measured on cost per action, based on MMP data.

To join up mobile acquisition with wider marketing activity, utilising a partner like Braze will enable seamless messaging from marketing, to email, to push notifications, allowing us to enhance communication with our target users, and improve our retention of customers.",June 2022 Yahoo RFI
Diversity and inclusion,,"Please describe how you integrate the concepts of ‘DEI’ and ‘Universal Inclusion’ into how you hire, develop and retain agency talent, how you conduct research and develop insights, and how you develop media and channel plans.","Our recruitment policies and business processes amplify the voice of people from underrepresented communities in the industry, by positioning our belief in equal employment opportunities and our value of the impact that diverse representation has on developing creative and innovative solutions. Jellyfish’s recruitment and business processes are deployed in a manner that reinforces our global values and the following principles:

The feeling of being part of a team
The feeling of being valued and respected
Safe space and a place to be heard

Our recruitment strategies include intentional promotion of our interest in underrepresented communities and solicitation of partnerships with organizations and schools such as HBCU’s. Jellyfish recruiting policies include diversity slating and panel interviewing to check for and remove bias within the hiring process. Jellyfish also ensures that job descriptions are gender neutral, accessible by people with disabilities and written using inclusive language.

Jellyfish’s business processes encourage collaboration across capabilities regardless of grade levels or job titles. Our commitment to improve efforts to Listen and Learn from underrepresented communities within our business has led to reformation of our organizational design that removes barriers, thereby improving accessibility to leaders and equity of voice. Diversity will be the byproduct of our focus on inclusion.

From the creation of Jellyfish we wanted there to be a difference in the social contract we had with our employees. For us, getting it right in the value we offered to the team was the biggest factor in then determining the success of our clients and therefore our business. We wanted to set ourselves up for success through placing our people first, they are our most valuable asset and this mantra continues today.

We have thrown out the traditional hierarchy, that agencies are supposed to be structured, interact and promote in a certain way. Jellyfish does things a little differently. We have a one Jellyfish structure, truly flat teams that recognize individuals who excel internally and/or externally. Unconscious bias is removed, decisions are based on outcomes and performance data, majority related to their role, sometimes not, promoting greatness across the team, not just in the superstars who naturally are in the limelight. More than 800 employees have been promoted since the grading structure was introduced, 51% of whom are women.

Removing unconscious bias from the process has helped the firm to recognize a more diverse array of talents. We distribute the accountability, we don’t delegate it. Whoever’s best placed to carry out a piece of work does so, cutting out any hierarchical layers in between. All of which means that line managers, in a traditional sense, are surplus to requirements. We have culturally adapted it to regions where it may not fit, for example in India, utilizing a group to help an individual due to it being culturally frowned upon to boast about an idea, initiative or input from oneself.

Our vision for diversity and inclusion is to create an environment that allows all Jellies to bring their true self to work, by promoting and investing in training and educational opportunities, raising awareness and providing strategies and tools to create a sustainable culture of inclusion, belonging, and equity that permeates through our employee and client experiences. We aspire to be One Jellyfish.

We are committed to:
- Promoting positive change through research, surveys and data analysis
- Identifying and promoting educational materials and opportunities
- Raising awareness through communication and openness
- Ensuring Jellyfish is a safe place for all employees to be their true self",June 2022 Yahoo RFI

Creative,,"How do you stay on top of innovation in media – trends, emergingtechnologies and cultural shifts – and how you bring those insights to your clients in the form of ideas to test and learn and to inform strategy.","We pride ourselves on constantly striving to find new and innovative client service solutions. This involves staying informed in the evolving industry and working to cultivate innovation into our tools, techniques, and processes. We employ a multi-faceted approach, including maintaining awareness of our competitors’ offerings, significant new hires, clients and technologies; networking; subscription to trade/industry publications and news; attendance at talks and industry events.

We then collate this information and regularly discuss new trends, innovations and examples of best practice internally and with our clients, particularly during monthly or bi-annual feedback sessions. Introducing smarter and interesting, innovative ways of working helps to facilitate continuous improvement across client accounts.

When it comes to innovation, we do not settle. We are constantly looking for smarter, better solutions for our clients. Automation, templating, asset reuse and optimization provide exciting, revolutionary opportunities to refine ways of working, reduce costs and increase speed to market.​

Jellyfish is designed to embody client innovation as a cultural standard and is a normal function of our partnership model. This structure throws traditional agency hierarchy out of the window. Agencies are typically structured to interact and promote in a certain way. We do this differently; unconscious bias is removed and decisions are based on outcomes and performance data promoting greatness across the teams, not just superstars who naturally are in the limelight.

HOW DO WE BRING THOSE INSIGHTS TO OUR CLIENTS IN THE FORM OF IDEAS TO TEST, LEARN, AND INFORM?

Our structural approach has provided a myriad of benefits but a major one was that it broke down the barriers of traditional hierarchical management tasks, freeing individuals time. This instead gets spent on contributions to client solutions and progress according to client goals and achievement. We have seen huge leaps in the solutions we are developing for clients and partners.

Relationships,,How does your company provide customer service on a domestic / regional basis?,"Jellyfish have offices in multiple territories, however as a (still rapidly growing) independent agency, we do not have the footprint of a big network agency. 

We do not see this as a disadvantage however due to our specialism, expertise, ability to drive performance from a central team and ability to collaborate well with media agencies / local in-market teams. 

Typically we would deploy an Account Lead who would be responsible for the overall strategic delivery and communication with the client team. They would then be supported by: a project manager/director; local account directors/manager; relevant skilled practitioners.  

We have worked with and currently do work with many very large global clients. In many instances we support in the development and deployment of a centralized best-pratice framework that can be rolled out to local markets whilst also ensuring they have the agility and flexibility to deliver campaigns specific to their audiences. 

We also help upskill and develop our clients' teams via our training proposition (https://www.jellyfish.co.uk/training/) and are Google's only globally accredited GMP training partner.

Due to having offices in UK, US, Europe and Africa, we are typically not constrained by timezones and in most cased can offer an always on / 24 hour support for our clients. 

Driving a central point of excellence with our clients ensures:

- Best practice framework that all local teams can adhere to
- Best in-class tech implemntation and support
- Centralized strategy that ensures common goals and approach
- Seemless sharing of insight and innovation
- Training division can help recruit and develop in market teams",

Account Management,,Will we have a full time dedicated Account Manager?,"We would plan to have a full time dedicated Account Manager on your business.  At Jellyfish, our approach is to provide you with account teams that are strategic partners— understanding your business objectives and category dynamics as well as bringing a high degree of digital marketing expertise to your business. Our account team members are much more than relationship owners; we train and expect them to be valuable members of your strategic marketing team. In addition to our account teams, each of our disciplines brings deep and broad SME experience to your business, providing expertise and thought leadership in their areas of focus.  ",
Account Management,,How will we be assured the responsiveness of dedicated personnel? How long will dedicated managers and supervisors be assigned to our account?  ,"Your dedicated Account Manager will be the day-to-day point of contact, but you will also have a connection with your channel specialists on the account.  Transparency and communication are key to our partnerships.  We’d scale up and down in team size at the executive levels based on seasonality and media plans.  We have a reputation for responsiveness, as a pillar of our boutique agency philosphy.",
Account Management,,Will resources be available to __________ after hours and outside of regularly scheduled meetings?  Explain.,"We serve clients today who require off-hours support, and __________ would be an account priority within our agency. We would accomplish the balance between quick response, off-hour needs, and team needs through: a strong core of dedicated resources; standard off-hour schedules for identified employees; a clear communications plan and SLAs; and a robust resource management process that enables us to apply ad hoc experts as needed. ",
Account Management,,"For a company with the size and complexity of __________, what is the structure of the dedicated team? How many dedicated FTEs? Which roles are on the account? If resources are shared, will dedicated time be transparently shared?","Our proposed team structure is outlined in the pricing tab.  A complex digital marketing program such as this requires a diverse set of specialized skills.  Some of these skills are required full-time, while others are required less than full time, or full time during peak times of the health insurance seasonal year and part time at other times of the year.   We look to apply the right skills at the right time in the program, so that you always feel you have access to your team members as needed.   For those that are not fully dedicated because their expertise is not required full time, we ensure that their other responsibilities allow them to be responsive to your needs.   We believe in fully and transparently sharing all time allocations based on your needs.",
Account Management,,How would you leverage the experience of your associates if they are located in an office other than yours?,"As a global company with prodigious technical expertise, we’re wired for collaboration using the latest tools available.

Our work with the following clients fits within that range:

1. Boa:  Our partnership with this shoe fastener manufacturer began in 2018, and we successfully launched the boa.com/boa.cn websites to showcase over 800 products across 14 countries and 10 languages. In addition we created a rules-based system for providing warranty support and an ecommerce platform to sell repair parts. 

2. FMC:  We started our partnership with FMC in 2018 to modernize and revamp their agricultural websites (US and  Canada). The scope includes creation of a user portal for consumers, vendors and agricultural experts. 

We are currently in the UX design phase for this project, which includes activities such as user interviews, wireframes, information architecture, and competitive analysis.

Relationships,,National/Local: What are the advantages of having both the national and local account? What are the disadvantages? ,"Many of our clients have both national and local strategies. Some of our most advanced national/local campaigns include:
1. A retail client that wants national coverage, but also the ability to promote specific consumers with unique messaging based on local store location, inventory, and promotions
2: A property listing client has specific targets based on location, but needs to defend their position against more aggressive competitors at a national level
3: An education client that has a local vs. national strategy based on performance, state legislation, and specific local events. 

At Jellyfish, we understand the different goals of National vs. Local accounts.  We believe the following critical elements have made our national/local campaigns a success.  
 1. Understanding/defining clear objectives at both the national and local level, including success metrics and measurement framework.
 2. Researching and analyzing all available data sources internally and externally to understand local market idiosyncrasies and potential impact.
 3. Creating and sharing a detailed plan with the whole team so everyone knows what we are looking to achieve at a national and local level.
 4. Carefully measuring performance against the plan and feeding back results to the relevant stakeholders.
 5. Being agile and able to iterate against the original plan based on campaign performance or new information.",
Relationships,,Partnership: Describe your ability to partner with other agencies.,"We work with other agencies for quite a few of our clients. Our goal is to work together with these agencies so that we work cohesively across the entire marketing funnel and keep client’s best interest in mind. 

As an example, we currently partner with Universal McCann on one of our client accounts. We provide strategic insights to paid media planning, including audience targeting tactics and pathways to landing pages for conversion. We concept and develop creative campaigns for Paid Social and Display media which is managed by Universal McCann, ensuring seamless communications at all stages of the creative process. We work with Universal McCann to ensure proper tagging is implemented, and team with them on reporting and analysis for our client.",
Media & SEO,,Please demonstrate what makes your agency’s Search Engine Marketing capabilities best in class,"Jellyfish’s Paid Search solution is driven by a mix of world-class, certified talent and best-in-class Search Marketing technology. We have an experienced and passionate team that looks after our clients with care. Results and performance are a given, and responsiveness comes as standard. Where technology is not readily available, we have the ability to design and create solutions to solve search campaign management challenges.

We have multiple examples where we've taken datasets from different pieces of our technology stack to make something unique. Everyone has an analytics package, a bidding platform, audience platform, and a DSP. What we are great at is taking different datasets between different tech and creating something new. We've done this with our Search Analysis Landscape Tool (SALT) and with Natural Language Processing to automate keyword growth. 

We're an approved Google Marketing Platform Partner with many more accolades and Google accreditations, we’re recognized in the industry for offering the very best in innovative marketing solutions. We have a unique relationship with Google, and we even train them on how to use and implement their own products. This partnership shows how we don't just say ""we're a leader,"" we prove it through our status as an official Google training partner. 

We have a formidable track record of success demonstrated by consistent year-on-year growth across our portfolio of search accounts. We focus on driving results by innovating in search. Some of our more recent award-winning campaigns for ""Local Search"" and ""Best Use of Data"" demonstrate how we've used new Search features and functions to benefit our clients, before their competitors are even aware the features exist!
",
Media & SEO,,Full-Suite Management Capabilities: Ability to fully-support and drive strategic growth of SEM in an omni-channel environment.,"We use a mix of SEM management, attribution and best-in-class feed tools. We also recognize that in order to differentiate a brand’s approach in SEM auctions, we must make the most of the business intelligence held within the brand. To do this, we have data experts who work with our clients to manipulate customer, sales, product and location data into our bidding platforms. This allows us to pivot the SEM campaigns in different ways to provide even more signals to bid with.  

We are technology agnostic and manage campaigns to a high level of performance through many SEM platforms, depending on our client’s preference. We primarily use Search Ads 360 as our SEM bid management platform of choice.  We also developed our own proprietary technology, called SafetyNet, that monitors SEM activity and alerts the team when critical performance anomalies occur. As an example, SafetyNet will automatically pause SEM activity if your website goes down and resumes activity when the website service returns. This was a small flaw in native, rule-based alerts with most SEM platforms that we took the initiative to correct. ",
Media & SEO,,"   How does your agency develop keyword lists, and make recommendations on potential adjustments of expansions?","We use a mixture of automated and manual methods for building out keyword lists. We use the website and product feed to guide the initial keyword strategy, as this helps us understand product-specific as well as category-level keyword requirements for the account. 

We use a keyword-builder tool to create relevant variations and have a thorough filtering process to ensure that we do not go live with irrelevant keywords. We also brainstorm and put ourselves in the searcher’s shoes to think of all possible variations and related searches that could be useful. 

To ensure we cover all bases, we use our aforementioned proprietary technology, SALT, to merge website content SEO ranking data with a keyword portfolio, and provide recommendations from Google Keyword Planner. We also use Search Monitor to evaluate keyword overlap between you and your competitors. Searches where you are not present are then added into the mix, and estimations of competition, volume, etc. are also appended. 

We use Dynamic Search Ads to pick up searches for very specific products/models with low search volume. While our keywords are active, we consistently mine raw search term reports for new keyword opportunities, as well as negative keywords that need to be applied. Our automated keyword mining solutions helps to streamline this process when building both positive and negative keyword lists. 

We have also used Inventory Keyword Campaigns where applicable through Search Ads 360, which uses the information from product feeds to create keywords, ads, and ad groups. These campaigns dynamically update based on the product feed. For example, if a price changes in the product feed, ad copy updates automatically. Furthermore, if a product is listed as out of stock within the feed, keywords and ads for that specific product would automatically be paused. 

To maintain keyword lists, we go through multiple processes to achieve different outcomes. We establish a set of top performing Priority keywords, for which we receive alerts whenever there are performance anomalies. We constantly review user journeys across devices for these terms to ensure optimal positioning and CPC range. The Priority keywords list may change over time, depending on seasonality, emerging products, and competition.",

Media & SEO,,Please describe your agency's philosophy and approach to Social Media Marketing,"We’ve had great success using social media’s ability for people-based marketing to help retailers match the right product or product category with the right people. We use the most relevant platforms and formats, personalized to where the consumer is in the purchase cycle, and believe that social media can play an important role in all stages of the consumer journey for both online and offline activity. The challenge that social media advertisers typically face is working in isolation of other media activity. However, Jellyfish’s brand promise of Creating Perfect Digital Journeys means our social media activity is always inclusive of a wider media strategy and our client's commercial goals. We also believe that digital media, especially social, is the barometer of consumer intent and we help our clients use the data from social to help inform product or product category trends. This can help surface what products are relevant to which groups in line with your head-to-toe strategy.

We believe in measuring meaningful metrics, reporting on what matters and being transparent with our planning, reporting, and data. Additionally, and audience-first approach is key for Jellyfish. We believe in an audience-led and data-based approach where data helps us build and optimize perfect digital journeys, identifying consumer behavior at each stage and personalizing the targeting, content, and messaging for optimal results. Through our integration with Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and Facebook ad tech, we have full funnel visibility that can be used to guide our decision making and optimization strategies both within and across channels. Our fit-for-purpose creative caters to audiences and channels in order to develop content that is most relevant. We also believe in thinking long-term while being adaptive.

By tracking multiple conversions throughout the journey, we can ensure we are reaching the right people and measuring performance of multiple KPIs to continually improve our campaigns. We partner with prefered technology partners to drive efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation aligned to business goals and objectives. For example, if we are driving sales for ____________, we'd use the Doubleclick integration to see the data in our tech solution, and create bid strategies to pull the necessary levers across different platforms and campaigns.

We also utilize a 360 approach to Social Media in order to allow us to make intelligent and informed decisions. We use multiple data points and sources to analyze audience behavior across on- and offline touchpoints to inform strategy, audiences, and content for our clients.

Core areas that we look at include:

- Brand Category
- Target Audience
- Brand & Product truth
- Cultural Trends
- Paid social performance

We are using best-in-class social listening tools and 3rd party research to feed the data into our strategic approach.",

Relationships,,". How are you leveraging the best of your agency capabilities to integrate specialist talent within the network with generalists in the lead agency?
How do you ensure that this is presented as a seamless agency product for your clients and operates as one P&L?

How do you apply this approach for local markets?
","FLAT STRUCTURE
At Jellyfish we’ve developed a unique identity, outside of the norm; outside of the networks; outside of traditional media agency culture. We’ve introduced a flat business model where unconscious bias has been removed, promoting greatness and diversity of thought across the team. Where decisions are based on performance data, not just the superstars who are naturally in the limelight. We’ve created a structure that encourages freedom to innovate, unified by a consistent yet agile process and culture. Where teams work in chorts of expertise to solve client issues, not by seniority or silo’s of departments. This has encouraged networks of our talent to form, united by client, specialist by their own capability and value they offer to the team and client. As a specialist agency, we extend this working practice with partner agencies, again united by driving brand’s growth, with KPIs placed cross agency to ensure motivations are aligned. 

ONE JELLYFISH
As part of our flat structure, we operate one P&L, and it’s a true one P&L. It doesn’t have capability or market level separation. Our country managers don’t have growth targets based on location of expertise or client. If we need to use an individual in a different market because they are the best to do the job, then we will. We strike a balance between best practices for team account structures that are simplified and organised, reflective of the client organisation but also maximise the best talent to solve for a challenge. 

TECHNOLOGY
We’ve evolved with platforms and partnered with them to get it right, for our customers. We’ve built innovative technology to overcome challenges that humans or existing technology couldn’t solve. We operate a fully front office team, so our clients have access to the experts they need. We connect our teams to clients own teams rather than separate front and back office function slowing down projects and progress. Engineers talking to engineers, legal to legal, finance to finance. 

TRAINING
We have a scaled training business at Jellyfish and have trained over 20,000 individuals in the past 3 years. We’ve nurtured our own  talent and culture through our academies, training practices and an extended network of flexibly accessed experts. As part of our larger client relationships we create schools of knowledge and training session across a multitude of subjects. Not only have we found this beneficial in developing our clients base knowledge, it has huge impacts in our clients understanding the depth and brilliance of the team.

Relationships,,"Please share with us your approach to multi-brand portfolio management. We’re interested in understanding your processes for talent, workflow management, governance, etc across many brands & many markets.
What challenges have you seen?

What opportunities exist for marketers
","We have worked with a number of clients who are considered a house of brands, including Deckers, PVH, and The Hut Group. There are obvious challenges which we navigate with clients who have a portfolio of brands, and the many ways in which those brands can require different approaches - scale, maturity, awareness, audience and customer overlap and prioritisation, internal stakeholders and structures to name a few.  Our core focus with these type of clients has been to ensure that the service, performance, innovation and dedication is as equal amongst the group as possible.

Whilst larger spending brands may seem like they need the balance of time, there is often bigger market headroom and significant gains to be had amongst smaller rapid growth brands. As part of our onboarding process we will make a full maturity assessment of brand, market and consumer to produce not only growth plans but ascertain the maturity of the marketing outputs. 

On a tactical level, we have found we can quickly make gains by changes in things like ad-tech account structures, KPI and measurement frameworks or media investments. With the brands’ media investments it is critical to understand how each is seen in market audience and product cross-over, with the creation of rules in media platforms based on the sales volumes per brand we are looking to achieve. 

The biggest opportunity with a house of brands used to be all about data sharing and promoting a single customer view at a group level. Although these can still be somewhat achieved where brands are non-competing, there are data legislation issues and often internal blockers still to be considered. We prefer to concentrate on the sharing of technology, creating efficiency via licensing of reporting, insight and activation tools. These instances are separated to ensure data compliance but with a universal taxonomy so teams like finance can ascertain holistic performance. 

In practical terms, to benefit from overall scale where a brand has smaller budgets than others, we can also tier service support in non core areas like advanced audience analysis, UX, CRM, or creative strategy.

Media & SEO,,"On FB/IG, what is your approach towards driving incremental sales? How do you advise clients on best practices to develop creative in order to maximize incremental sales?","When it comes to driving incremental sales and ad performance on FB/IG, we lean heavily on working to feed the algorithm with the right signals and allowing it to optimise. We couple this with a robust 'test and learn' methodology so we know what is actually driving incremental sales. For example we've used conversion path analysis to uncover the incremental impact FB/IG traffic was having on conversions compared to other channels. 

We know that around 60% of the performance across FB/IG is driven by creative. We work closely with our Creative and Experience teams to understand the elements that drive effectiveness - we then take the results and recommendations to clients to action in campaigns going forward.

When working with an influencer, we see best results when the content is amplified with media spend. We would also recommend using the Branded Content Ad format.",Peloton July 2022

Creative,,"Are you a SAG signatory? If not, what is your process if/and when needed?","Jellyfish is not currently a SAG-AFTRA signatory, as we reserve the right to work with union and non union crew worldwide. SAG's contract may restrict what is possible for us, and open us up to legal challenges if we work with non union or SAG actors outside of the signatory terms going forward.

SAG projects/ workaround:
When working on productions where we hire SAG actors directly, or for when SAG talent is mandated by the client for larger productions, we choose to work with 3rd party production companies who are SAG signatories.
When working on SAG projects with 3rd party production companies who are signatories, we set a production only budget for the shoot component of the project. That budget is what the production company uses to pay everyone associated with the project, from actors to writers, etc. that they have contracted.

Non SAG Projects:
When working with non SAG talent, we are able to choose a direct in house production route, or 3rd party production companies based on the requirements of the project.

Even though Jellyfish is not a union signatory, when we hire non-union actors, we still endeavour to treat the actors ethically, pay them reasonably, and only have to negotiate the terms directly with with the talent (and sometimes their agents). Usage, territories, media, residuals and buy-outs, etc. are negotiated directly. This simplifies the workflow and record keeping and we often find for below the line advertising, non union actors still provide a great talent pool.",

Relationships,,"How do you manage to retain and attract talent at your agency? Please detail. 
What do you put in place to face the current talent shortage in the industry?
","We have put our answers for these two questions together as we view them as equally important. How we attract, retain and navigate industry issues, all stems from how our business has been built, the recognition that our people are lifeblood and key to our and our clients success.

From the creation of The Brandtech Group we wanted there to be a difference in the social contract we had with our employees. For us, getting it right in the value we offer to the team is the biggest factor in determining the success of our clients and therefore our business. We set ourselves up for success by placing our people first, they are our most valuable asset. 

We have thrown out the traditional hierarchy, that agencies are supposed to be structured, interact and promote in a certain way. The Brandtech Group does things a little differently. We have a one company structure, truly flat teams that recognize individuals who excel internally and/or externally. Unconscious bias is removed, decisions are based on outcomes and performance data, majority related to their role, sometimes not, promoting greatness across the team, not just in the superstars who naturally are in the limelight. More than 800 employees have been promoted since the grading structure was introduced, 57% of whom are women. Removing unconscious bias from the process has helped the firm to recognize a more diverse array of talents. We distribute the accountability, we don’t delegate it. Whoever’s best placed to carry out a piece of work does so, cutting out any hierarchical layers in between. All of which means that line managers, in a traditional sense, are surplus to requirements. We have culturally adapted it to regions where it may not fit, for example in India, utilizing a group to help an individual due to it being culturally frowned upon to boast about an idea, initiative or input from oneself.

Breaking down the barriers and escaping the onerous traditional hierarchical tasks means freeing individuals to make the contributions they are able to make, and progress according to their own goals and achievement. Removing unconscious bias from the process has helped the business to recognize a more diverse array of talents. As we promote and enable individuals across the business with very diverse and differentiated skill sets, we have seen innovation prosper. Giving people the time and freedom to develop ideas has meant that we have seen huge leaps in the solutions we are developing for clients and partners. Incremental gains have become the minimum.

Company Overview,,What makes us unique?,"We understand innovation, responsible disruption and driving value for our clients. In the last 18 years, we have continually transformed Jellyfish, broadening to wider marketing communication capabilities from our base of performance marketing.  

We’ve developed a unique identity, outside of the norm; outside of the networks; outside of traditional media agency culture. A model that reflects Jellyfish success from our clients’ growth
We’ve introduced a flat business model where unconscious bias has been removed, promoting greatness and diversity of thought across the team. Where decisions are based on performance data, not just the superstars who are naturally in the limelight
We’ve balanced creative, data and technology to create seamless brand and performance experiences for consumers 
We’ve created a structure that encourages freedom to innovate, unified by a consistent yet agile process and culture
We’ve nurtured our talent and culture through our academies, training practices and an extended network of flexibly accessed experts leading to an average attrition rate of 16% (UK) over the last 3 years.
We’ve evolved with platforms and partnered with them to get it right, for our customers
We’ve built innovative technology to overcome challenges that humans or existing technology 
couldn’t solve

Talent,,How we attract and retain talent at Jellyfish,"In a context where most companies in the digital industry offer the same types of benefits (workplace flexibility, equipment budget, à la carte benefits…) we believe that our very unique 'One Jellyfish' operational model, replacing the traditional 'pyramid structure' with a networking matrix, is Jellyfish’s key USP to attract and retain the best talents
In a nutshell:

Personal Support Networks (PSN) replace the traditional 121 line manager structure where an employee's development was determined by one person

Titles are consolidated to align the global business and minimize confusion in responsibility

A grading system is acting as a tangible progression path to replace ambiguous promotions and to ensure employees are appropriately recognized for the value they bring

This allows employees to be remunerated for their efforts up to 3 times a year, with standardised salary increase relative to their work location, and capability

Automated anniversary increases replaced traditional annual performance reviews to ensure progression (+ own inflation) and an individual's anniversary are mutually exclusive

Employees were put back in control of their own development and the anonymous promotions process is also aiming to remove bias as a blind panel is assessing Business Cases
In summary, Jellyfish has built the foundations of a unique model to empower every individual, improving their experience and providing them with more progression opportunities.  And we constantly evolve it.

Talent,,"Do you leverage subcontractors and/or freelancers for client work? If so, for 
what/in what capacity?","Yes, Jellyfish will use the expertise of freelancers/contractors in the scenario that we do not have the capacity or skillset within the agency.

This provides the team with a scalable approach to identify freelancers who we wish to work with again, and also identify freelancers who are not suitable and were unable to satisfy our quality criteria.
At the beginning of each project, freelancers complete training managed by in-house Content Managers against the client’s brief before working on any live tasks. Freelancers’ work is continually reviewed by the Content Manager on the account. We also have a built-in grading functionality in our proprietary platform J+ Scribe that allows Jellyfish to monitor the quality of work delivered by each individual.",ADM RFI - Media Digital Creative Global 2023
